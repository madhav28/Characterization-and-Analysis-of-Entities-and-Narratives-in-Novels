How are you going to keep the game up?\" \"Oh What are you going to do about it \"There What are you doing this afternoon \" \"Can\\'t it, though There \" \"Can\\'t it, though There The advertisement has appeared, and--there are only two answers!\" \"Tommy, you devil How could you be so mean And do remember, as I have pointed out to you before, that as a clergyman\\'s daughter----\" \"I ought to be on the stage One, two, three, go \"Well, the question is, what do you know about her looked so respectable that Tuppence\\'s heart sank. Upon Tommy\\'s request for Mr. Carter, she showed them into a small study on the ground floor where she left them. Hardly a minute elapsed, however, before the door opened, and a tall man with a lean hawklike face and a tired manner entered the room. \"Mr. Y. A.?\" he said, and smiled. His smile was distinctly attractive. \"Do sit down, both of you.\" They obeyed. He himself took a chair opposite to Tuppence and smiled at her encouragingly. There was something in the quality of his smile that made the girl\\'s usual readiness desert her. As he did not seem inclined to open the conversation, Tuppence was forced to begin. \"We wanted to know--that is, would you be so kind as to tell us anything you know about Jane Finn?\" \"Jane Finn? Ah!\" Mr. Carter appeared to reflect. \"Well, the question is, what do you know about her?\" Tuppence drew herself up. \"I don\\'t see that that\\'s got anything to do with it.\" \"No? But it has, you know, really it has.\" He smiled again in his tired way, and continued reflectively. \"So that brings us down to it again. What do you know about Jane Finn? \"Come now,\" he continued, as Tuppence remained silent. \"You must know SOMETHING to have advertised as you did?\" He leaned forward a little, his weary voice held a hint of persuasiveness. \"Suppose you tell me...\" There was something very magnetic about Mr. Carter\\'s personality. Tuppence seemed to shake herself free of it with an effort, as she said: \"We couldn\\'t do that, could we, Tommy?\" But to her surprise, her companion did not back her up. His eyes were fixed on Mr. Carter, and his tone when he spoke held an unusual note of deference. \"I dare say the little we know won\\'t be any good to you, sir. But such as it is, you\\'re welcome to it.\" \"Tommy!\" cried out Tuppence in surprise. Mr. Carter slewed round in his chair. His eyes asked a question. Tommy nodded. \"Yes, sir, I recognized you at once. Saw you in France when I was with the Intelligence. As soon as you came into the room, I knew----\" Mr. Carter held up his hand. \"No names, please. I\\'m known as Mr. Carter here. It\\'s my cousin\\'s house, by the way. She\\'s willing to lend it to me sometimes when it\\'s a case of working on strictly unofficial lines. Well, now\"--he looked from one to the other--\"who\\'s going to tell me the story?\" \"Fire ahead, Tuppence,\" directed Tommy. \"It\\'s your yarn.\" \"Yes, little lady, out with it.\" And obediently Tuppence did out with it, telling the whole story from the forming of the Young Adventurers, Ltd., downwards. Mr. Carter listened in silence with a resumption of his tired manner. Now and then he passed his hand across his lips as though to hide a smile. When she had finished he nodded gravely. \"Not much. But suggestive. Quite suggestive. If you\\'ll excuse my saying so, you\\'re a curious young couple. I don\\'t know--you might succeed where others have failed... I believe in luck, you know--always have....\" He paused a moment, and then went on. \"Well, how about it? You\\'re out for adventure. How would you like to work for me? All quite unofficial, you know. Expenses paid, and a moderate screw?\" Tuppence gazed at him, her lips parted, her eyes growing wider and wider. \"What should we have to do?\" she breathed. Mr. Carter smiled. \"Just go on with what you\\'re doing now. FIND JANE FINN.\" \"Yes, but--who IS Jane Finn?\" Mr. Carter nodded gravely. \"Yes, you\\'re entitled to know that, I think.\" He leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs, brought the tips of his fingers together, and began in a low monotone: \"Secret diplomacy (which, by the way, is nearly always bad policy!) does not concern you. It will be sufficient to say that in the early days of 1915 a certain document came into being. It was the draft of a secret agreement--treaty--call it what you like. It was drawn up ready for signature by the various representatives, and drawn up in America--at that time a neutral country. It was dispatched to England by a special messenger selected for that purpose, a young fellow called Danvers. It was hoped that the whole affair had been kept so secret that nothing would have leaked out. That kind of hope is usually disappointed. Somebody always talks! \"Danvers sailed for England on the Lusitania. He carried the precious papers in an oilskin packet which he wore next his skin. It was on that particular voyage that the Lusitania was torpedoed and sunk. Danvers was among the list of those missing. Eventually his body was washed ashore, and identified beyond any possible doubt. But the oilskin packet was missing! \"The question was, had it been taken from him, or had he himself passed it on into another\\'s keeping? There were a few incidents that strengthened the possibility of the latter theory. After the torpedo struck the ship, in the few moments during the launching of the boats, Danvers was seen speaking to a young American girl. No one actually saw him pass anything to her, but he might have done so. It seems to me quite likely that he entrusted the papers to this girl, believing that she, as a woman, had a greater chance of bringing them safely to shore. \"But if so, where was the girl, and what had she done with the papers? By later advice from America it seemed likely that Danvers had been closely shadowed on the way over. Was this girl in league with his enemies? Or had she, in her turn, been shadowed and either tricked or forced into handing over the precious packet? \"We set to work to trace her out. It proved unexpectedly difficult. Her name was Jane Finn, and it duly appeared among the list of the survivors, but th \"Well, the question is, what do you know about her What do you know about Jane Finn \" \"Tommy Well, now\"--he looked from one to the other--\"who\\'s going to tell me the story Expenses paid, and a moderate screw \" He paused, and then said quietly: \"You may perhaps have heard or read that there is Bolshevist influence at work behind the present Labour unrest \" \"Oh Brown!

Julius nodded, and continued: \"\\'How did it happen?\\' I asked again. He replied dryly. \\'You fell, with a considerable portion of one of my trees, into one of my newly planted flower-beds.\\' \"I liked the man. He seemed to have a sense of humour. I felt sure that he, at least, was plumb straight. \\'Sure, doc,\\' I said, \\'I\\'m sorry about the tree, and I guess the new bulbs will be on me. But perhaps you\\'d like to know what I was doing in your garden?\\' \\'I think the facts do call for an explanation,\\' he replied. \\'Well, to begin with, I wasn\\'t after the spoons.\\' \"He smiled. \\'My first theory. But I soon altered my mind. By the way, you are an American, are you not?\\' I told him my name. \\'And you?\\' \\'I am Dr. Hall, and this, as you doubtless know, is my private nursing home.\\' \"I didn\\'t know, but I wasn\\'t going to put him wise. I was just thankful for the information. I liked the man, and I felt he was straight, but I wasn\\'t going to give him the whole story. For one thing he probably wouldn\\'t have believed it. \"I made up my mind in a flash. \\'Why, doctor,\\' I said, \\'I guess I feel an almighty fool, but I owe it to you to let you know that it wasn\\'t the Bill Sikes business I was up to.\\' Then I went on and mumbled out something about a girl. I trotted out the stern guardian business, and a nervous breakdown, and finally explained that I had fancied I recognized her among the patients at the home, hence my nocturnal adventures. I guess it was just the kind of story he was expecting. \\'Quite a romance,\\' he said genially, when I\\'d finished. \\'Now, doc,\\' I went on, \\'will you be frank with me? Have you here now, or have you had here at any time, a young girl called Jane Finn?\\' He repeated the name thoughtfully. \\'Jane Finn?\\' he said. \\'No.\\' \"I was chagrined, and I guess I showed it. \\'You are sure?\\' \\'Quite sure, Mr. Hersheimmer. It is an uncommon name, and I should not have been likely to forget it.\\' \"Well, that was flat. It laid me out for a space. I\\'d kind of hoped my search was at an end. \\'That\\'s that,\\' I said at last. \\'Now, there\\'s another matter. When I was hugging that darned branch I thought I recognized an old friend of mine talking to one of your nurses.\\' I purposely didn\\'t mention any name because, of course, Whittington might be calling himself something quite different down here, but the doctor answered at once. \\'Mr. Whittington, perhaps?\\' \\'That\\'s the fellow,\\' I replied. \\'What\\'s he doing down here? Don\\'t tell me HIS nerves are out of order?\\' \"Dr. Hall laughed. \\'No. He came down to see one of my nurses, Nurse Edith, who is a niece of his.\\' \\'Why, fancy that!\\' I exclaimed. \\'Is he still here?\\' \\'No, he went back to town almost immediately.\\' \\'What a pity!\\' I ejaculated. \\'But perhaps I could speak to his niece--Nurse Edith, did you say her name was?\\' \"But the doctor shook his head. \\'I\\'m afraid that, too, is impossible. Nurse Edith left with a patient to-night also.\\' \\'I seem to be real unlucky,\\' I remarked. \\'Have you Mr. Whittington\\'s address in town? I guess I\\'d like to look him up when I get back.\\' \\'I don\\'t know his address. I can write to Nurse Edith for it if you like.\\' I thanked him. \\'Don\\'t say who it is wants it. I\\'d like to give him a little surprise.\\' \"That was about all I could do for the moment. Of course, if the girl was really Whittington\\'s niece, she might be too cute to fall into the trap, but it was worth trying. Next thing I did was to write out a wire to Beresford saying where I was, and that I was laid up with a sprained foot, and telling him to come down if he wasn\\'t busy. I had to be guarded in what I said. However, I didn\\'t hear from him, and my foot soon got all right. It was only ricked, not really sprained, so to-day I said good-bye to the little doctor chap, asked him to send me word if he heard from Nurse Edith, and came right away back to town. Say, Miss Tuppence, you\\'re looking mighty pale!\" \"It\\'s Tommy,\" said Tuppence. \"What can have happened to him?\" \"Buck up, I guess he\\'s all right really. Why shouldn\\'t he be? See here, it was a foreign-looking guy he went off after. Maybe they\\'ve gone abroad--to Poland, or something like that?\" Tuppence shook her head. \"He couldn\\'t without passports and things. Besides I\\'ve seen that man, Boris Something, since. He dined with Mrs. Vandemeyer last night.\" \"Mrs. Who?\" \"I forgot. Of course you don\\'t know all that.\" \"I\\'m listening,\" said Julius, and gave vent to his favourite expression. \"Put me wise.\" Tuppence thereupon related the events of the last two days. Julius\\'s astonishment and admiration were unbounded. \"Bully for you! Fancy you a menial. It just tickles me to death!\" Then he added seriously: \"But say now, I don\\'t like it, Miss Tuppence, I sure don\\'t. You\\'re just as plucky as they make \\'em, but I wish you\\'d keep right out of this. These crooks we\\'re up against would as soon croak a girl as a man any day.\" \"Do you think I\\'m afraid?\" said Tuppence indignantly, valiantly repressing memories of the steely glitter in Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s eyes. \"I said before you were darned plucky. But that doesn\\'t alter facts.\" \"Oh, bother ME!\" said Tuppence impatiently. \"Let\\'s think about what can have happened to Tommy. I\\'ve written to Mr. Carter about it,\" she added, and told him the gist of her letter. Julius nodded gravely. \"I guess that\\'s good as far as it goes. But it\\'s for us to ge Say, Miss Tuppence, you\\'re looking mighty pale Maybe they\\'ve gone abroad--to Poland, or something like that It just tickles me to death \" \"Do you think I\\'m afraid \" \"Oh, bother ME It just tickles me to death \" \"Do you think I\\'m afraid \" \"Oh, bother ME \" \"What can we do \" \"Why should he \" \"Oh \"How did you get it \" \"Well \"You have a message for me Vandemeyer, I suppose \"Suppose the lady brings a libel action against me for defamation of character \"Suppose the lady brings a libel action against me for defamation of character \"Ah \" \"Oh \" \"Yes, but how \" \"Who is that \" \"How \"Oh, I feel so much better \"Isn\\'t he a duck \"I say, miss, she\\'s a-going!\" \"Who\\'s going \" \"What \"I say, miss, she\\'s a-going!\" \"Who\\'s going \" \"What \"You And you\\'ll sleep--oh yes, my little spy, you\\'ll sleep all right \"What\\'s that \"What\\'s that But you shall pay for it--oh, yes, you shall pay for it!

Don\\'t they, old thing?\" \"I don\\'t know what you mean,\" said Julius stiffly, but a large and burning blush overspread his countenance. \"Shucks!\" retorted Tuppence. She laughed, and closed the door, reopening it to add with dignity: \"Morally, I shall always consider I have been jilted!\" \"What was it?\" asked Jane as Tuppence rejoined her. \"Julius.\" \"What did he want?\" \"Really, I think, he wanted to see you, but I wasn\\'t going to let him. Not until to-night, when you\\'re going to burst upon every one like King Solomon in his glory! Come on! WE\\'RE GOING TO SHOP!\" To most people the 29th, the much-heralded \"Labour Day,\" had passed much as any other day. Speeches were made in the Park and Trafalgar Square. Straggling processions, singing the Red Flag, wandered through the streets in a more or less aimless manner. Newspapers which had hinted at a general strike, and the inauguration of a reign of terror, were forced to hide their diminished heads. The bolder and more astute among them sought to prove that peace had been effected by following their counsels. In the Sunday papers a brief notice of the sudden death of Sir James Peel Edgerton, the famous K.C., had appeared. Monday\\'s paper dealt appreciatively with the dead man\\'s career. The exact manner of his sudden death was never made public. Tommy had been right in his forecast of the situation. It had been a one-man show. Deprived of their chief, the organization fell to pieces. Kramenin had made a precipitate return to Russia, leaving England early on Sunday morning. The gang had fled from Astley Priors in a panic, leaving behind, in their haste, various damaging documents which compromised them hopelessly. With these proofs of conspiracy in their hands, aided further by a small brown diary taken from the pocket of the dead man which had contained a full and damning resume of the whole plot, the Government had called an eleventh-hour conference. The Labour leaders were forced to recognize that they had been used as a cat\\'s paw. Certain concessions were made by the Government, and were eagerly accepted. It was to be Peace, not War! But the Cabinet knew by how narrow a margin they had escaped utter disaster. And burnt in on Mr. Carter\\'s brain was the strange scene which had taken place in the house in Soho the night before. He had entered the squalid room to find that great man, the friend of a lifetime, dead--betrayed out of his own mouth. From the dead man\\'s pocket-book he had retrieved the ill-omened draft treaty, and then and there, in the presence of the other three, it had been reduced to ashes.... England was saved! And now, on the evening of the 30th, in a private room at the Savoy, Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was receiving his guests. Mr. Carter was the first to arrive. With him was a choleric-looking old gentleman, at sight of whom Tommy flushed up to the roots of his hair. He came forward. \"Ha!\" said the old gentleman, surveying him apoplectically. \"So you\\'re my nephew, are you? Not much to look at--but you\\'ve done good work, it seems. Your mother must have brought you up well after all. Shall we let bygones be bygones, eh? You\\'re my heir, you know; and in future I propose to make you an allowance--and you can look upon Chalmers Park as your home.\" \"Thank you, sir, it\\'s awfully decent of you.\" \"Where\\'s this young lady I\\'ve been hearing such a lot about?\" Tommy introduced Tuppence. \"Ha!\" said Sir William, eyeing her. \"Girls aren\\'t what they used to be in my young days.\" \"Yes, they are,\" said Tuppence. \"Their clothes are different, perhaps, but they themselves are just the same.\" \"Well, perhaps you\\'re right. Minxes then--minxes now!\" \"That\\'s it,\" said Tuppence. \"I\\'m a frightful minx myself.\" \"I believe you,\" said the old gentleman, chuckling, and pinched her ear in high good-humour. Most young women were terrified of the \"old bear,\" as they termed him. Tuppence\\'s pertness delighted the old misogynist. Then came the timid archdeacon, a little bewildered by the company in which he found himself, glad that his daughter was considered to have distinguished herself, but unable to help glancing at her from time to time with nervous apprehension. But Tuppence behaved admirably. She forbore to cross her legs, set a guard upon her tongue, and steadfastly refused to smoke. Dr. Hall came next, and he was followed by the American Ambassador. \"We might as well sit down,\" said Julius, when he had introduced all his guests to each other. \"Tuppence, will you----\" He indicated the place of honour with a wave of his hand. But Tuppence shook her head. \"No--that\\'s Jane\\'s place! When one thinks of how she\\'s held out all these years, she ought to be made the queen of the feast to-night.\" Julius flung her a grateful glance, and Jane came forward shyly to the allotted seat. Beautiful as she had seemed before, it was as nothing to the loveliness that now went fully adorned. Tuppence had performed her part faithfully. The model gown supplied by a famous dressmaker had been entitled \"A tiger lily.\" It was all golds and reds and browns, and out of it rose the pure column of the girl\\'s white throat, and the bronze masses of hair that crowned her lovely head. There was admiration in every eye, as she took her seat. Soon the supper party was in full swing, and with one accord Tommy was called upon for a full and complete explanation. \"You\\'ve bee I had--and still have--the highest sentiments of esteem and respect--and admiration for you----\" \"H\\'m \"Shucks She laughed, and closed the door, reopening it to add with dignity: \"Morally, I shall always consider I have been jilted!\" \"What was it \" \"Where\\'s this young lady I\\'ve been hearing such a lot about Minxes then--minxes now \" \"Where It had been got away from me once, and I determined I wouldn\\'t let on I\\'d got it until a photographer had made a dozen copies of it \"Why \" \"Oh \"I--oh, dash it all, Tuppence, you know', 'Cowley': '\"Now then,\" said Tommy, \"where shall we go Miss Prudence Cowley, known to her intimate friends for some mysterious reason as \"Tuppence.\" She pounced at once. \"Tommy, you\\'re stony!\" \"Not a bit of it,\" declared Tommy unconvincingly. \"Rolling in cash.\" \"You always were a shocking liar,\" said Tuppence severely, \"though you did once persuade Sister Greenbank that the doctor had ordered you beer as a tonic, but forgotten to write it on the chart. Do you remember?\" Tommy chuckled. \"I should think I did! Wasn\\'t the old cat in a rage when she found out? Not that she was a bad sort really, old Mother Greenbank! Good old hospital--demobbed like everything else, I suppose?\" Tuppence sighed. \"Yes. You too?\" Tommy nodded. \"Two months ago.\" \"Gratuity?\" hinted Tuppence. \"Spent.\" \"Oh, Tommy!\" \"No, old thing, not in riotous dissipation. No such luck! The cost of living--ordinary plain, or garden living nowadays is, I assure you, if you do not know----\" \"My dear child,\" interrupted Tuppence, \"there is nothing I do NOT know about the cost of living. Here we are at Lyons\\', and we will each of us pay for our own. That\\'s it!\" And Tuppence led the way upstairs. The place was full, and they wandered about looking for a table, catching odds and ends of conversation as they did so. \"And--do you know, she sat down and CRIED when I told her she couldn\\'t have the flat after all.\" \"It was simply a BARGAIN, my dear! Just like the one Mabel Lewis brought from Paris----\" \"Funny scraps one does overhear,\" murmured Tommy. \"I passed two Johnnies in the street to-day talking about some one called Jane Finn. Did you ever hear such a name?\" But at that moment two elderly ladies rose and collected parcels, and Tuppence deftly ensconced herself in one of the vacant seats. Tommy ordered tea and buns. Tuppence ordered tea and buttered toast. \"And mind the tea comes in separate teapots,\" she added severely. Tommy sat down opposite her. His bared head revealed a shock of exquisitely slicked-back red hair. His face was pleasantly ugly--nondescript, yet unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a sportsman. His brown suit was well cut, but perilously near the end of its tether. They were an essentially modern-looking couple as they sat there. Tuppence had no claim to beauty, but there was character and charm in the elfin lines of her little face, with its determined chin and large, wide-apart grey eyes that looked mistily out from under straight, black brows. She wore a small bright green toque over her black bobbed hair, and her extremely short and rather shabby skirt revealed a pair of uncommonly dainty ankles. Her appearance presented a valiant attempt at smartness. The tea came at last, and Tuppence, rousing herself from a fit of meditation, poured it out. \"Now then,\" said Tommy, taking a large bite of bun, \"let\\'s get up-to-date. Remember, I haven\\'t seen you since that time in hospital in 1916.\" \"Very well.\" Tuppence helped herself liberally to buttered toast. \"Abridged biography of Miss Prudence Cowley, fifth daughter of Archdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell, Suffolk. Miss Cowley left the delights (and drudgeries) of her home life early in the war and came up to London, where she entered an officers\\' hospital. First month: Washed up six hundred and forty-eight plates every day. Second month: Promoted to drying aforesaid plates. Third month: Promoted to peeling potatoes. Fourth month: Promoted to cutting bread and butter. Fifth month: Promoted one floor up to duties of wardmaid with mop and pail. Sixth month: Promoted to waiting at table. Seventh month: Pleasing appearance and nice manners so striking that am promoted to waiting on the Sisters! Eighth month: Slight check in career. Sister Bond ate Sister Westhaven\\'s egg! Grand row! Wardmaid clearly to blame! Inattention in such important matters cannot be too highly censured. Mop and pail again! How are the mighty fallen! Ninth month: Promoted to sweeping out wards, where I found a friend of my childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford (bow, Tommy!), whom I had not seen for five long years. The meeting was affecting! Tenth month: Reproved by matron for visiting the pictures in company with one of the patients, namely: the aforementioned Lieutenant Thomas Beresford. Eleventh and twelfth months: Parlourmaid duties resumed with entire success. At the end of the year left hospital in a blaze of glory. After that, the talented Miss Cowley drove successively a trade delivery van, a motor-lorry and a general! The last was the pleasantest. He was quite a young general!\" \"What brighter was that?\" inquired Tommy. \"Perfectly sickening the way those brass hats drove from the War Office to the Savoy, and from the Savoy to the War Office!\" \"I\\'ve forgotten his name now,\" confessed Tuppence. \"To resume, that was in a way the apex of my career. I next entered a Government office. We had several very enjoyable tea parties. I had intended to become a land girl, a postwoman, and a bus conductress by way of rounding off my career--but the Armistice intervened! I clung to the office with the true limpet touch for many long months, but, alas, I was combed out at last. Since then I\\'ve been looking for a job. Now then--your turn.\" \"There\\'s not so much promotion in mine,\" said Tommy regretfully, \"and a great deal less variety. I went out to France again, as you know. Then they sent me to Mesopotamia, and I got wounded for the second time, and went into hospital out there. Then I got stuck in Egypt till the Armistice happened, kicked my heels there some time longer, and, as I told you, finally got demobbed. And, for ten long, weary months I\\'ve been job hunting!

The Lusitania had been struck by two torpedoes in succession and was sinking rapidly, while the boats were being launched with all possible speed. The women and children were being lined up awaiting their turn. Some still clung desperately to husbands and fathers; others clutched their children closely to their breasts. One girl stood alone, slightly apart from the rest. She was quite young, not more than eighteen. She did not seem afraid, and her grave, steadfast eyes looked straight ahead. \"I beg your pardon.\" A man\\'s voice beside her made her start and turn. She had noticed the speaker more than once amongst the first-class passengers. There had been a hint of mystery about him which had appealed to her imagination. He spoke to no one. If anyone spoke to him he was quick to rebuff the overture. Also he had a nervous way of looking over his shoulder with a swift, suspicious glance. She noticed now that he was greatly agitated. There were beads of perspiration on his brow. He was evidently in a state of overmastering fear. And yet he did not strike her as the kind of man who would be afraid to meet death! \"Yes?\" Her grave eyes met his inquiringly. He stood looking at her with a kind of desperate irresolution. \"It must be!\" he muttered to himself. \"Yes--it is the only way.\" Then aloud he said abruptly: \"You are an American?\" \"Yes.\" \"A patriotic one?\" The girl flushed. \"I guess you\\'ve no right to ask such a thing! Of course I am!\" \"Don\\'t be offended. You wouldn\\'t be if you knew how much there was at stake. But I\\'ve got to trust some one--and it must be a woman.\" \"Why?\" \"Because of \\'women and children first.\\'\" He looked round and lowered his voice. \"I\\'m carrying papers--vitally important papers. They may make all the difference to the Allies in the war. You understand? These papers have GOT to be saved! They\\'ve more chance with you than with me. Will you take them?\" The girl held out her hand. \"Wait--I must warn you. There may be a risk--if I\\'ve been followed. I don\\'t think I have, but one never knows. If so, there will be danger. Have you the nerve to go through with it?\" The girl smiled. \"I\\'ll go through with it all right. And I\\'m real proud to be chosen! What am I to do with them afterwards?\" \"Watch the newspapers! I\\'ll advertise in the personal column of the Times, beginning \\'Shipmate.\\' At the end of three days if there\\'s nothing--well, you\\'ll know I\\'m down and out. Then take the packet to the American Embassy, and deliver it into the Ambassador\\'s own hands. Is that clear?\" \"Quite clear.\" \"Then be ready--I\\'m going to say good-bye.\" He took her hand in his. \"Good-bye. Good luck to you,\" he said in a louder tone. Her hand closed on the oilskin packet that had lain in his palm. The Lusitania settled with a more decided list to starboard. In answer to a quick command, the girl went forward to take her place in the boat. CHAPTER I. THE YOUNG ADVENTURERS, LTD. \"TOMMY, old thing!\" \"Tuppence, old bean!\" The two young people greeted each other affectionately, and momentarily blocked the Dover Street Tube exit in doing so. The adjective \"old\" was misleading. Their united ages would certainly not have totalled forty-five. \"Not seen you for simply centuries,\" continued the young man. \"Where are you off to? Come and chew a bun with me. We\\'re getting a bit unpopular here--blocking the gangway as it were. Let\\'s get out of it.\" The girl assenting, they started walking down Dover Street towards Piccadilly. \"Now then,\" said Tommy, \"where shall we go?\" The very faint anxiety which underlay his tone did not escape the astute ears of Miss Prudence Cowley, known to her intimate friends for some mysterious reason as \"Tuppence.\" She pounced at once. \"Tommy, you\\'re stony!\" \"Not a bit of it,\" declared Tommy unconvincingly. \"Rolling in cash.\" \"You always were a shocking liar,\" said Tuppence severely, \"though you did once persuade Sister Greenbank that the doctor had ordered you beer as a tonic, but forgotten to write it on the chart. Do you remember?\" Tommy chuckled. \"I should think I did! Wasn\\'t the old cat in a rage when she found out? Not that she was a bad sort really, old Mother Greenbank! Good old hospital--demobbed like everything else, I suppose?\" Tuppence sighed. \"Yes. You too?\" Tommy nodded. \"Two months ago.\" \"Gratuity?\" hinted Tuppence. \"Spent.\" \"Oh, Tommy!\" \"No, old thing, not in riotous dissipation. No such luck! The cost of living--ordinary plain, or garden living nowadays is, I assure you, if you do not know----\" \"My dear child,\" interrupted Tuppence, \"there is nothing I do NOT know about the cost of living. Here we are at Lyons\\', and we will each of us pay for our own. That\\'s it!\" And Tuppence led the way upstairs. The place was full, and they wandered about looking fo', 'Tommy': '\"Tommy, you\\'re stony Do you remember You too \"Tommy, you\\'re stony Do you remember You too \" \"It was simply a BARGAIN, my dear Mop and pail again! How are the mighty fallen He was quite a young general!\" \"What brighter was that \"I shouldn\\'t like the colonies--and I\\'m perfectly certain they wouldn\\'t like me!\" \"Rich relations \" \"Rot I don\\'t want to go back, but--oh, Tommy, what else is there to do There was a silence, and then Tuppence burst out: \"Money, money, money!

Here I am bursting with news, and absolutely no one to tell it to Say, Miss Tuppence, you\\'re looking mighty pale her quick-wittedness, in reality she had relied upon Tommy more than she realized at the time. There was something so eminently sober and clear-headed about him, his common sense and soundness of vision were so unvarying, that without him Tuppence felt much like a rudderless ship. It was curious that Julius, who was undoubtedly much cleverer than Tommy, did not give her the same feeling of support. She had accused Tommy of being a pessimist, and it is certain that he always saw the disadvantages and difficulties which she herself was optimistically given to overlooking, but nevertheless she had really relied a good deal on his judgment. He might be slow, but he was very sure. It seemed to the girl that, for the first time, she realized the sinister character of the mission they had undertaken so lightheartedly. It had begun like a page of romance. Now, shorn of its glamour, it seemed to be turning to grim reality. Tommy--that was all that mattered. Many times in the day Tuppence blinked the tears out of her eyes resolutely. \"Little fool,\" she would apostrophize herself, \"don\\'t snivel. Of course you\\'re fond of him. You\\'ve known him all your life. But there\\'s no need to be sentimental about it.\" In the meantime, nothing more was seen of Boris. He did not come to the flat, and Julius and the car waited in vain. Tuppence gave herself over to new meditations. Whilst admitting the truth of Julius\\'s objections, she had nevertheless not entirely relinquished the idea of appealing to Sir James Peel Edgerton. Indeed, she had gone so far as to look up his address in the Red Book. Had he meant to warn her that day? If so, why? Surely she was at least entitled to demand an explanation. He had looked at her so kindly. Perhaps he might tell them something concerning Mrs. Vandemeyer which might lead to a clue to Tommy\\'s whereabouts. Anyway, Tuppence decided, with her usual shake of the shoulders, it was worth trying, and try it she would. Sunday was her afternoon out. She would meet Julius, persuade him to her point of view, and they would beard the lion in his den. When the day arrived Julius needed a considerable amount of persuading, but Tuppence held firm. \"It can do no harm,\" was what she always came back to. In the end Julius gave in, and they proceeded in the car to Carlton House Terrace. The door was opened by an irreproachable butler. Tuppence felt a little nervous. After all, perhaps it WAS colossal cheek on her part. She had decided not to ask if Sir James was \"at home,\" but to adopt a more personal attitude. \"Will you ask Sir James if I can see him for a few minutes? I have an important message for him.\" The butler retired, returning a moment or two later. \"Sir James will see you. Will you step this way?\" He ushered them into a room at the back of the house, furnished as a library. The collection of books was a magnificent one, and Tuppence noticed that all one wall was devoted to works on crime and criminology. There were several deep-padded leather arm-chairs, and an old-fashioned open hearth. In the window was a big roll-top desk strewn with papers at which the master of the house was sitting. He rose as they entered. \"You have a message for me? Ah\"--he recognized Tuppence with a smile--\"it\\'s you, is it? Brought a message from Mrs. Vandemeyer, I suppose?\" \"Not exactly,\" said Tuppence. \"In fact, I\\'m afraid I only said that to be quite sure of getting in. Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Hersheimmer, Sir James Peel Edgerton.\" \"Pleased to meet you,\" said the American, shooting out a hand. \"Won\\'t you both sit down?\" asked Sir James. He drew forward two chairs. \"Sir James,\" said Tuppence, plunging boldly, \"I dare say you will think it is most awful cheek of me coming here like this. Because, of course, it\\'s nothing whatever to do with you, and then you\\'re a very important person, and of course Tommy and I are very unimportant.\" She paused for breath. \"Tommy?\" queried Sir James, looking across at the American. \"No, that\\'s Julius,\" explained Tuppence. \"I\\'m rather nervous, and that makes me tell it badly. What I really want to know is what you meant by what you said to me the other day? Did you mean to warn me against Mrs. Vandemeyer? You did, didn\\'t you?\" \"My dear young lady, as far as I recollect I only mentioned that there were equally good situations to be obtained elsewhere.\" \"Yes, I know. But it was a hint, wasn\\'t it?\" \"Well, perhaps it was,\" admitted Sir James gravely. \"Well, I want to know more. I want to know just WHY you gave me a hint.\" Sir James smiled at her earnestness. \"Suppose the lady brings a libel action against me for defamation of character?\" \"Of course,\" said Tuppence. \"I know lawyers are always dreadfully careful. But can\\'t we say \\'without prejudice\\' first, and then say just what we want to.\" \"Well,\" said Sir James, still smiling, \"without prejudice, then, if I had a young sister forced to earn her living, I should not like to see her in Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s service. I felt it incumbent on me just to give you a hint. It is no place for a young and inexperienced girl. That is all I can tell you.\" \"I see,\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. \"Thank you very much. But I\\'m not REALLY inexperienced, you know. I knew perfectly that she was a bad lot when I went there--as a matter of fact that\\'s WHY I went----\" She broke off, seeing some bewilderment on the lawyer\\'s face, and went on: \"I think perhaps I\\'d better tell you the whole story, Sir James. I\\'ve a sort of feeling that you\\'d know in a minute if I didn\\'t tell the truth, and so you might a \"Ah \" \"What\\'s his name Why don\\'t you take it? Grab it? Snatch at it? What more do you want And what the devil was the matter with his head? \"Damn FROM a darkness punctuated with throbbing stabs of fire, Tommy dragged his senses slowly back to life. When he at last opened his eyes, he was conscious of nothing but an excruciating pain through his temples. He was vaguely aware of unfamiliar surroundings. Where was he? What had happened? He blinked feebly. This was not his bedroom at the Ritz. And what the devil was the matter with his head? \"Damn!\" said Tommy, and tried to sit up. He had remembered. He was in that sinister house in Soho. He uttered a groan and fell back. Through his almost-closed lids he reconnoitred carefully. \"He is coming to,\" remarked a voice very near Tommy\\'s ear. He recognized it at once for that of the bearded and efficient German, and lay artistically inert. He felt that it would be a pity to come round too soon; and until the pain in his head became a little less acute, he felt quite incapable of collecting his wits. Painfully he tried to puzzle out what had happened. Obviously somebody must have crept up behind him as he listened and struck him down with a blow on the head. They knew him now for a spy, and would in all probability give him short shrift. Undoubtedly he was in a tight place. Nobody knew where he was, therefore he need expect no outside assistance, and must depend solely on his own wits. \"Well, here goes,\" murmured Tommy to himself, and repeated his former remark. \"Damn!\" he observed, and this time succeeded in sitting up. In a minute the German stepped forward and placed a glass to his lips, with the brief command \"Drink.\" Tommy obeyed. The potency of the draught made him choke, but it cleared his brain in a marvellous manner. He was lying on a couch in the room in which the meeting had been held. On one side of him was the German, on the other the villainous-faced doorkeeper who had let him in. The others were grouped together at a little distance away. But Tommy missed one face. The man known as Number One was no longer of the company. \"Feel better?\" asked the German, as he removed the empty glass. \"Yes, thanks,\" returned Tommy cheerfully. \"Ah, my young friend, it is lucky for you your skull is so thick. The good Conrad struck hard.\" He indicated the evil-faced doorkeeper by a nod. The man grinned. Tommy twisted his head round with an effort. \"Oh,\" he said, \"so you\\'re Conrad, are you? It strikes me the thickness of my skull was lucky for you too. When I look at you I feel it\\'s almost a pity I\\'ve enabled you to cheat the hangman.\" The man snarled, and the bearded man said quietly: \"He would have run no risk of that.\" \"Just as you like,\" replied Tommy. \"I know it\\'s the fashion to run down the police. I rather believe in them myself.\" His manner was nonchalant to the last degree. Tommy Beresford was one of those young Englishmen not distinguished by any special intellectual ability, but who are emphatically at their best in what is known as a \"tight place.\" Their natural diffidence and caution fall from them like a glove. Tommy realized perfectly that in his own wits lay the only chance of escape, and behind his casual manner he was racking his brains furiously. The cold accents of the German took up the conversation: \"Have you anything to say before you are put to death as a spy?\" \"Simply lots of things,\" replied Tommy with the same urbanity as before. \"Do you deny that you were listening at that door?\" \"I do not. I must really apologize--but your conversation was so interesting that it overcame my scruples.\" \"How did you get in?\" \"Dear old Conrad here.\" Tommy smiled deprecatingly at him. \"I hesitate to suggest pensioning off a faithful servant, but you really ought to have a better watchdog.\" Conrad snarled impotently, and said sullenly, as the man with the beard swung round upon him: \"He gave the word. How was I to know?\" \"Yes,\" Tommy chimed in. \"How was he to know? Don\\'t blame the poor fellow. His hasty action has given me the pleasure of seeing you all face to face.\" He fancied that his words caused some discomposure among the group, but the watchful German stilled it with a wave of his hand. \"Dead men tell no tales,\" he said evenly. \"Ah,\" said Tommy, \"but I\\'m not dead yet!\" \"You soon will be, my young friend,\" said the German. An assenting murmur came from the others. Tommy\\'s heart beat faster, but his casual pleasantness did not waver. \"I think not,\" he said firmly. \"I should have a great objection to dying.\" He had got them puzzled, he saw that by the look on his captor\\'s face. \"Can you give us any reason why we should not put you to death?\" asked the German. \"Several,\" replied Tommy. \"Look here, you\\'ve been asking me a lot of questions. Let me ask you one for a change. Why didn\\'t you kill me off at once before I regained consciousness?\" The German hesitated, and Tommy seized his advantage. \"Because you didn\\'t know how much I knew--and where I obtained that knowledge. If you kill me now, you never will know.\" But here the emotions of Boris became too much for him. He stepped forward waving his arms. \"You hell-hound of a spy,\" he screamed. \"We will give you short shrift. Kill him! Kill him!\" There was a roar of applause. \"You hear?\" said the German, his eyes on Tommy. \"What have you to say to that?\" \"Say?\" Tommy shrugged his shoulders. \"Pack of fools. Let them ask themselves a few questions. How did I get into this place? Remember what dear old Conrad said--WITH YOUR OWN PASSWORD, wasn\\'t it? How did I get hold of that? You don\\'t suppose I came up those steps haphazard and said the first thin And what the devil was the matter with his head? \"Damn The cold accents of the German took up the conversation: \"Have you anything to say before you are put to death as a spy How was I to know Why didn\\'t you kill me off at once before I regained consciousness \"You hear \"What have you to say to that?\" \"Say Why didn\\'t you kill me off at once before I regained consciousness \"You hear \"What have you to say to that?\" \"Say How did I get into this place?

You have got them, then I have a theory----\" \"Pah \" \"Idiot \" \"Idiot \"Do you think we are little children to let you walk out of here leaving us a pretty story full of promises Otherwise, death \" The other looked at him curiously for some minutes, then he said slowly, and as though choosing his words with care: \"Do you not know that she can tell you nothing \" \"Then why see her \" \"Who \"Hang it all And then--and then, simply walk out \"Oh Monsieur parle francais \"Oh Monsieur parle francais \" \"Oh \"Wouldn\\'t you do anything to help another girl \"What the devil---- \"What the devil---- \"Think we\\'re as green as to do you in here, and have the police nosing round?

Conrad, what is it Do you think you can go halfway, and then swing yourself down BEHIND the ladder, so that they will not see you Go to your room And suddenly there was an outcry overhead, an exclamation from the German, and then Annette\\'s voice, clear and high: \"Ma foi, he has escaped! And quickly! Who would have thought it TO MARGUERITE In a minute he had the pleasure of seeing his two pursuers, of whom the German was one, industriously tracking down the red herring \" \"Who thought I was dead But, say, can\\'t you shed that British calm of yours, and get down to it?

There was a moment\\'s pause, and then Tommy reverted to Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s death. \"There\\'s no doubt it was chloral?\" \"I believe not. At least they call it heart failure induced by an overdose, or some such claptrap. It\\'s all right. We don\\'t want to be worried with an inquest. But I guess Tuppence and I and even the highbrow Sir James have all got the same idea.\" \"Mr. Brown?\" hazarded Tommy. \"Sure thing.\" Tommy nodded. \"All the same,\" he said thoughtfully, \"Mr. Brown hasn\\'t got wings. I don\\'t see how he got in and out.\" \"How about some high-class thought transference stunt? Some magnetic influence that irresistibly impelled Mrs. Vandemeyer to commit suicide?\" Tommy looked at him with respect. \"Good, Julius. Distinctly good. Especially the phraseology. But it leaves me cold. I yearn for a real Mr. Brown of flesh and blood. I think the gifted young detectives must get to work, study the entrances and exits, and tap the bumps on their foreheads until the solution of the mystery dawns on them. Let\\'s go round to the scene of the crime. I wish we could get hold of Tuppence. The Ritz would enjoy the spectacle of the glad reunion.\" Inquiry at the office revealed the fact that Tuppence had not yet returned. \"All the same, I guess I\\'ll have a look round upstairs,\" said Julius. \"She might be in my sitting-room.\" He disappeared. Suddenly a diminutive boy spoke at Tommy\\'s elbow: \"The young lady--she\\'s gone away by train, I think, sir,\" he murmured shyly. \"What?\" Tommy wheeled round upon him. The small boy became pinker than before. \"The taxi, sir. I heard her tell the driver Charing Cross and to look sharp.\" Tommy stared at him, his eyes opening wide in surprise. Emboldened, the small boy proceeded. \"So I thought, having asked for an A.B.C. and a Bradshaw.\" Tommy interrupted him: \"When did she ask for an A.B.C. and a Bradshaw?\" \"When I took her the telegram, sir.\" \"A telegram?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"When was that?\" \"About half-past twelve, sir.\" \"Tell me exactly what happened.\" The small boy drew a long breath. \"I took up a telegram to No. 891--the lady was there. She opened it and gave a gasp, and then she said, very jolly like: \\'Bring me up a Bradshaw, and an A.B.C., and look sharp, Henry.\\' My name isn\\'t Henry, but----\" \"Never mind your name,\" said Tommy impatiently. \"Go on.\" \"Yes, sir. I brought them, and she told me to wait, and looked up something. And then she looks up at the clock, and \\'Hurry up,\\' she says. \\'Tell them to get me a taxi,\\' and she begins a-shoving on of her hat in front of the glass, and she was down in two ticks, almost as quick as I was, and I seed her going down the steps and into the taxi, and I heard her call out what I told you.\" The small boy stopped and replenished his lungs. Tommy continued to stare at him. At that moment Julius rejoined him. He held an open letter in his hand. \"I say, Hersheimmer\"--Tommy turned to him--\"Tuppence has gone off sleuthing on her own.\" \"Shucks!\" \"Yes, she has. She went off in a taxi to Charing Cross in the deuce of a hurry after getting a telegram.\" His eye fell on the letter in Julius\\'s hand. \"Oh; she left a note for you. That\\'s all right. Where\\'s she off to?\" Almost unconsciously, he held out his hand for the letter, but Julius folded it up and placed it in his pocket. He seemed a trifle embarrassed. \"I guess this is nothing to do with it. It\\'s about something else--something I asked her that she was to let me know about.\" \"Oh!\" Tommy looked puzzled, and seemed waiting for more. \"See here,\" said Julius suddenly, \"I\\'d better put you wise. I asked Miss Tuppence to marry me this morning.\" \"Oh!\" said Tommy mechanically. He felt dazed. Julius\\'s words were totally unexpected. For the moment they benumbed his brain. \"I\\'d like to tell you,\" continued Julius, \"that before I suggested anything of the kind to Miss Tuppence, I made it clear that I didn\\'t want to butt in in any way between her and you----\" Tommy roused himself. \"That\\'s all right,\" he said quickly. \"Tuppence and I have been pals for years. Nothing more.\" He lit a cigarette with a hand that shook ever so little. \"That\\'s quite all right. Tuppence always said that she was looking out for----\" He stopped abruptly, his face crimsoning, but Julius was in no way discomposed. \"Oh, I guess it\\'ll be the dollars that\\'ll do the trick. Miss Tuppence put me wise to that right away. There\\'s no humbug about her. We ought to gee along together very well.\" Tommy looked at him curiously for a minute, as though he were about to speak, then changed his mind and said nothing. Tuppence and Julius! Well, why not? Had she not lamented the fact that she knew no rich men? Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance? Her meeting with the young American millionaire had given her the chance--and it was unlikely she would be slow to avail herself of it. She was out for money. She had always said so. Why blame her because she had been true to her creed? Nevertheless, Tommy did blame her. He was filled with a passionate and utterly illogical resentment. It was all very well to SAY things like that--but a REAL girl would never marry for money. Tuppence was utterly cold-blooded and selfish, and he would be delighted if he never saw her again! And it was a rotten world! Julius\\'s voice broke in on these meditations. \"Yes, we ought to get along together very well. I\\'ve heard that a girl always refuses you once--a sort of convention.\" Tommy caught his arm. \"Refuses? Did you say REFUSES?\" \"Sur Brown Vandemeyer to commit suicide \"What \" \"Oh \" \"Oh Why blame her because she had been true to her creed Why blame her because she had been true to her creed \" \"What about the car But it gets my goat to think of that innocent young girl in danger In a moment or two, he said: \"I say, Julius, what do they want her for, anyway?\" \"Eh?

I persuaded him to come on the trip for his health.\" The Russian remained mute, still livid with terror. \"But what made them let us go?\" demanded Tuppence suspiciously. \"I reckon Monsieur Kramenin here asked them so prettily they just couldn\\'t refuse!\" This was too much for the Russian. He burst out vehemently: \"Curse you--curse you! They know now that I betrayed them. My life won\\'t be safe for an hour in this country.\" \"That\\'s so,\" assented Julius. \"I\\'d advise you to make tracks for Russia right away.\" \"Let me go, then,\" cried the other. \"I have done what you asked. Why do you still keep me with you?\" \"Not for the pleasure of your company. I guess you can get right off now if you want to. I thought you\\'d rather I tooled you back to London.\" \"You may never reach London,\" snarled the other. \"Let me go here and now.\" \"Sure thing. Pull up, George. The gentleman\\'s not making the return trip. If I ever come to Russia, Monsieur Kramenin, I shall expect a rousing welcome, and----\" But before Julius had finished his speech, and before the car had finally halted, the Russian had swung himself out and disappeared into the night. \"Just a mite impatient to leave us,\" commented Julius, as the car gathered way again. \"And no idea of saying good-bye politely to the ladies. Say, Jane, you can get up on the seat now.\" For the first time the girl spoke. \"How did you \\'persuade\\' him?\" she asked. Julius tapped his revolver. \"Little Willie here takes the credit!\" \"Splendid!\" cried the girl. The colour surged into her face, her eyes looked admiringly at Julius. \"Annette and I didn\\'t know what was going to happen to us,\" said Tuppence. \"Old Whittington hurried us off. We thought it was lambs to the slaughter.\" \"Annette,\" said Julius. \"Is that what you call her?\" His mind seemed to be trying to adjust itself to a new idea. \"It\\'s her name,\" said Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide. \"Shucks!\" retorted Julius. \"She may think it\\'s her name, because her memory\\'s gone, poor kid. But it\\'s the one real and original Jane Finn we\\'ve got here.\" \"What?\" cried Tuppence. But she was interrupted. With an angry spurt, a bullet embedded itself in the upholstery of the car just behind her head. \"Down with you,\" cried Julius. \"It\\'s an ambush. These guys have got busy pretty quickly. Push her a bit, George.\" The car fairly leapt forward. Three more shots rang out, but went happily wide. Julius, upright, leant over the back of the car. \"Nothing to shoot at,\" he announced gloomily. \"But I guess there\\'ll be another little picnic soon. Ah!\" He raised his hand to his cheek. \"You are hurt?\" said Annette quickly. \"Only a scratch.\" The girl sprang to her feet. \"Let me out! Let me out, I say! Stop the car. It is me they\\'re after. I\\'m the one they want. You shall not lose your lives because of me. Let me go.\" She was fumbling with the fastenings of the door. Julius took her by both arms, and looked at her. She had spoken with no trace of foreign accent. \"Sit down, kid,\" he said gently. \"I guess there\\'s nothing wrong with your memory. Been fooling them all the time, eh?\" The girl looked at him, nodded, and then suddenly burst into tears. Julius patted her on the shoulder. \"There, there--just you sit tight. We\\'re not going to let you quit.\" Through her sobs the girl said indistinctly: \"You\\'re from home. I can tell by your voice. It makes me home-sick.\" \"Sure I\\'m from home. I\\'m your cousin--Julius Hersheimmer. I came over to Europe on purpose to find you--and a pretty dance you\\'ve led me.\" The car slackened speed. George spoke over his shoulder: \"Cross-roads here, sir. I\\'m not sure of the way.\" The car slowed down till it hardly moved. As it did so a figure climbed suddenly over the back, and plunged head first into the midst of them. \"Sorry,\" said Tommy, extricating himself. A mass of confused exclamations greeted him. He replied to them severally: \"Was in the bushes by the drive. Hung on behind. Couldn\\'t let you know before at the pace you were going. It was all I could do to hang on. Now then, you girls, get out!\" \"Get out?\" \"Yes. There\\'s a station just up that road. Train due in three minutes. You\\'ll catch it if you hurry.\" \"What the devil are you driving at?\" demanded Julius. \"Do you think you can fool them by leaving the car?\" \"You and I aren\\'t going to leave the car. Only the girls.\" \"You\\'re crazed, Beresford. Stark staring mad! You can\\'t let those girls go off alone. It\\'ll be the end of it if you do.\" Tommy turned to Tuppence. \"Get out at once, Tuppence. Take her with you, and do just as I say. No one will do you any harm. You\\'re safe. Take the train to London. Go straight to Sir James Peel Edgerton. Mr. Carter lives out of town, but you\\'ll be safe with him.\" \"Darn you!\" cried Julius. \"You\\'re mad. Jane, you stay where you are.\" With a sudden swift movement, Tommy snatched the revolver from Julius\\'s hand, and levelled it at him. \"Now will you believe I\\'m in earnest? Get out, both of you, and do as I say--or I\\'ll shoot!\" Tuppence sprang out, dragging the unwilling Jane after her. \"Come on, it\\'s all right. If Tommy\\'s sure--he\\'s sure. Be quick. We\\'ll miss the train.\" They started running. Julius\\'s pent-up rage burst forth. \"What the hell---- Brown already be assembling against them \"\\'Ave, Caesar \" \"Where\\'s this young lady I\\'ve been hearing such a lot about \" \"Hear! hear And then I got a bogus note from Tuppence--and I knew!\" \"But how \"I--oh, dash it all, Tuppence, you know \" \"Did you ask how much \" \"Tuppence, you are the limit \" \"Whose flat?\" \"You think I mind saying it, but I don\\'t in the least!

Between now and to-morrow morning. How could he know, even?\" \"You forget your own suggestion of a dictaphone,\" said Sir James dryly. \"We have a very formidable adversary. I believe, if we exercise all due care, that there is a very good chance of his being delivered into our hands. But we must neglect no precaution. We have an important witness, but she must be safeguarded. I would suggest that Miss Tuppence should go to bed, and that you and I, Mr. Hersheimmer, should share the vigil.\" Tuppence was about to protest, but happening to glance at the bed she saw Mrs. Vandemeyer, her eyes half-open, with such an expression of mingled fear and malevolence on her face that it quite froze the words on her lips. For a moment she wondered whether the faint and the heart attack had been a gigantic sham, but remembering the deadly pallor she could hardly credit the supposition. As she looked the expression disappeared as by magic, and Mrs. Vandemeyer lay inert and motionless as before. For a moment the girl fancied she must have dreamt it. But she determined nevertheless to be on the alert. \"Well,\" said Julius, \"I guess we\\'d better make a move out of here any way.\" The others fell in with his suggestion. Sir James again felt Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s pulse. \"Perfectly satisfactory,\" he said in a low voice to Tuppence. \"She\\'ll be absolutely all right after a night\\'s rest.\" The girl hesitated a moment by the bed. The intensity of the expression she had surprised had impressed her powerfully. Mrs. Vandemeyer lifted her lids. She seemed to be struggling to speak. Tuppence bent over her. \"Don\\'t--leave----\" she seemed unable to proceed, murmuring something that sounded like \"sleepy.\" Then she tried again. Tuppence bent lower still. It was only a breath. \"Mr.--Brown----\" The voice stopped. But the half-closed eyes seemed still to send an agonized message. Moved by a sudden impulse, the girl said quickly: \"I shan\\'t leave the flat. I shall sit up all night.\" A flash of relief showed before the lids descended once more. Apparently Mrs. Vandemeyer slept. But her words had awakened a new uneasiness in Tuppence. What had she meant by that low murmur: \"Mr. Brown?\" Tuppence caught herself nervously looking over her shoulder. The big wardrobe loomed up in a sinister fashion before her eyes. Plenty of room for a man to hide in that.... Half-ashamed of herself, Tuppence pulled it open and looked inside. No one--of course! She stooped down and looked under the bed. There was no other possible hiding-place. Tuppence gave her familiar shake of the shoulders. It was absurd, this giving way to nerves! Slowly she went out of the room. Julius and Sir James were talking in a low voice. Sir James turned to her. \"Lock the door on the outside, please, Miss Tuppence, and take out the key. There must be no chance of anyone entering that room.\" The gravity of his manner impressed them, and Tuppence felt less ashamed of her attack of \"nerves.\" \"Say,\" remarked Julius suddenly, \"there\\'s Tuppence\\'s bright boy. I guess I\\'d better go down and ease his young mind. That\\'s some lad, Tuppence.\" \"How did you get in, by the way?\" asked Tuppence suddenly. \"I forgot to ask.\" \"Well, Albert got me on the phone all right. I ran round for Sir James here, and we came right on. The boy was on the look out for us, and was just a mite worried about what might have happened to you. He\\'d been listening outside the door of the flat, but couldn\\'t hear anything. Anyhow he suggested sending us up in the coal lift instead of ringing the bell. And sure enough we landed in the scullery and came right along to find you. Albert\\'s still below, and must be just hopping mad by this time.\" With which Julius departed abruptly. \"Now then, Miss Tuppence,\" said Sir James, \"you know this place better than I do. Where do you suggest we should take up our quarters?\" Tuppence considered for a moment or two. \"I think Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s boudoir would be the most comfortable,\" she said at last, and led the way there. Sir James looked round approvingly. \"This will do very well, and now, my dear young lady, do go to bed and get some sleep.\" Tuppence shook her head resolutely. \"I couldn\\'t, thank you, Sir James. I should dream of Mr. Brown all night!\" \"But you\\'ll be so tired, child.\" \"No, I shan\\'t. I\\'d rather stay up--really.\" The lawyer gave in. Julius reappeared some minutes later, having reassured Albert and rewarded him lavishly for his services. Having in his turn failed to persuade Tuppence to go to bed, he said decisively: \"At any rate, you\\'ve got to have something to eat right away. Where\\'s the larder?\" Tuppence directed him, and he returned in a few minutes with a cold pie and three plates. After a hearty meal, the girl felt inclined to pooh-pooh her fancies of half an hour before. The power of the money bribe could not fail. \"And now, Miss Tuppence,\" said Sir James, \"we want to hear your adventures.\" \"That\\'s so,\" agreed Julius. Tuppence narrated her adventures with some complacence. Julius occasionally interjected an admiring \"Bully.\" Sir James said nothing until she had finished, when his quiet \"well done, Miss Tuppence,\" made her flush with pleasure. \"There\\'s one thing I don\\'t get clearly,\" said Julius. \"What put her up to clearing out?\" \"I don\\'t know,\" confessed Tuppence. Sir James stroked his chin thoughtfully. \"The room was in great disorder. That looks as though her flight was unpremeditated. Almost as though she got a sudden warning to go from some one.\" \"Mr. Brown, I suppose,\" said Julius scoffingly. The lawyer looked at him deliberately fo How could he know, even \"Why not Gee, if I ever lay hands on it again, I\\'ll freeze on to it like--like hell \"I never thought of that \"Hooray I suppose we might call her that \"Hooray I suppose we might call her that Hall \" \"And the heart trouble? Ha ha \"Supposing she is not able to give one?\" \"What You have just said that she is perfectly sane.\" \"So she is. Nevertheless, if you want a statement from her concerning any events prior to May 7, 1915, she will not be able to give it to you.\" They looked at the little man, stupefied. He nodded cheerfully. \"It\\'s a pity,\" he said. \"A great pity, especially as I gather, Sir James, that the matter is important. But there it is, she can tell you nothing.\" \"But why, man? Darn it all, why?\" The little man shifted his benevolent glance to the excited young American. \"Because Janet Vandemeyer is suffering from a complete loss of memory.\" \"WHAT?\" \"Quite so. An interesting case, a very interesting case. Not so uncommon, really, as you would think. There are several very well known parallels. It\\'s the first case of the kind that I\\'ve had under my own personal observation, and I must admit that I\\'ve found it of absorbing interest.\" There was something rather ghoulish in the little man\\'s satisfaction. \"And she remembers nothing,\" said Sir James slowly. \"Nothing prior to May 7, 1915. After that date her memory is as good as yours or mine.\" \"Then the first thing she remembers?\" \"Is landing with the survivors. Everything before that is a blank. She did not know her own name, or where she had come from, or where she was. She couldn\\'t even speak her own tongue.\" \"But surely all this is most unusual?\" put in Julius. \"No, my dear sir. Quite normal under the circumstances. Severe shock to the nervous system. Loss of memory proceeds nearly always on the same lines. I suggested a specialist, of course. There\\'s a very good man in Paris--makes a study of these cases--but Mrs. Vandemeyer opposed the idea of publicity that might result from such a course.\" \"I can imagine she would,\" said Sir James grimly. \"I fell in with her views. There is a certain notoriety given to these cases. And the girl was very young--nineteen, I believe. It seemed a pity that her infirmity should be talked about--might damage her prospects. Besides, there is no special treatment to pursue in such cases. It is really a matter of waiting.\" \"Waiting?\" \"Yes, sooner or later, the memory will return--as suddenly as it went. But in all probability the girl will have entirely forgotten the intervening period, and will take up life where she left off--at the sinking of the Lusitania.\" \"And when do you expect this to happen?\" The doctor shrugged his shoulders. \"Ah, that I cannot say. Sometimes it is a matter of months, sometimes it has been known to be as long as twenty years! Sometimes another shock does the trick. One restores what the other took away.\" \"Another shock, eh?\" said Julius thoughtfully. \"Exactly. There was a case in Colorado----\" The little man\\'s voice trailed on, voluble, mildly enthusiastic. Julius did not seem to be listening. He had relapsed into his own thoughts and was frowning. Suddenly he came out of his brown study, and hit the table such a resounding bang with his fist that every one jumped, the doctor most of all. \"I\\'ve got it! I guess, doc, I\\'d like your medical opinion on the plan I\\'m about to outline. Say Jane was to cross the herring pond again, and the same thing was to happen. The submarine, the sinking ship, every one to take to the boats--and so on. Wouldn\\'t that do the trick? Wouldn\\'t it give a mighty big bump to her subconscious self, or whatever the jargon is, and start it functioning again right away?\" \"A very interesting speculation, Mr. Hersheimmer. In my own opinion, it would be successful. It is unfortunate that there is no chance of the conditions repeating themselves as you suggest.\" \"Not by nature, perhaps, doc. But I\\'m talking about art.\" \"Art?\" \"Why, yes. What\\'s the difficulty? Hire a liner----\" \"A liner!\" murmured Dr. Hall faintly. \"Hire some passengers, hire a submarine--that\\'s the only difficulty, I guess. Governments are apt to be a bit hidebound over their engines of war. They won\\'t sell to the firstcomer. Still, I guess that can be got over. Ever heard of the word \\'graft,\\' sir? Well, graft gets there every time! I reckon that we shan\\'t really need to fire a torpedo. If every one hustles round and screams loud enough that the ship is sinking, it ought to be enough for an innocent young girl like Jane. By the time she\\'s got a life-belt on her, and is being hustled into a boat, with a well-drilled lot of artistes doing the hysterical stunt on deck, why--she ought to be right back where she was in May, 1915. How\\'s that for the bare outline?\" Dr. Hall looked at Julius. Everything that he was for the moment incapable of saying was eloquent in that look. \"No,\" said Julius, in answer to it, \"I\\'m not crazy. The thing\\'s perfectly possible. It\\'s done every day in the States for the movies. Haven\\'t you seen trains in collision on the screen? What\\'s the difference between buying up a train and buying up a liner? Get the properties and you can go right ahead!\" Dr. Hall found his voice. \"But the expense, my dear sir.\" His voice rose. \"The expense! It will be COLOSSAL!\" \"Money doesn\\'t worry me any,\" explained Julius simply. Dr. Hall turned an appealing face to Sir James, who smiled slightly. \"Mr. Hersheimmer is very well off--very well off indeed.\" The doctor\\'s glance came back to Julius with a new and subtle quality in it. This was no longer an eccentric young fellow with a habit of falling off trees. The doctor\\'s eyes held the deference accorded to a really rich man. \"Very remarkable plan. Very remarkable,\" he murmured. \"The movies--of course! Your American word for the kinema. Very interesting. I fear we are perhaps a little behind the times over here in our methods. And you really mean to carry out this remarkable plan of yours.\" \"You be \" \"Another shock, eh \" \"Nothing \"And--Tommy What about it?\" \"I don\\'t understand you,\" replied Tuppence with dignity, adding rather inconsequently: \"And, anyway, you\\'re wrong!\" \"Not got a sort of kindly feeling for one another You look the sort of girl that\\'s mighty often getting fallen in love with!\" \"Oh What are you going to do And what the devil was the matter with his head? \"Damn And what the devil was the matter with his head? \"Damn \"Ah,\" said Tommy, \"but I\\'m not dead yet \"You hear How did I get into this place How did I get into this place?

There was a moment\\'s pause, and then Tommy reverted to Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s death. \"There\\'s no doubt it was chloral?\" \"I believe not. At least they call it heart failure induced by an overdose, or some such claptrap. It\\'s all right. We don\\'t want to be worried with an inquest. But I guess Tuppence and I and even the highbrow Sir James have all got the same idea.\" \"Mr. Brown?\" hazarded Tommy. \"Sure thing.\" Tommy nodded. \"All the same,\" he said thoughtfully, \"Mr. Brown hasn\\'t got wings. I don\\'t see how he got in and out.\" \"How about some high-class thought transference stunt? Some magnetic influence that irresistibly impelled Mrs. Vandemeyer to commit suicide?\" Tommy looked at him with respect. \"Good, Julius. Distinctly good. Especially the phraseology. But it leaves me cold. I yearn for a real Mr. Brown of flesh and blood. I think the gifted young detectives must get to work, study the entrances and exits, and tap the bumps on their foreheads until the solution of the mystery dawns on them. Let\\'s go round to the scene of the crime. I wish we could get hold of Tuppence. The Ritz would enjoy the spectacle of the glad reunion.\" Inquiry at the office revealed the fact that Tuppence had not yet returned. \"All the same, I guess I\\'ll have a look round upstairs,\" said Julius. \"She might be in my sitting-room.\" He disappeared. Suddenly a diminutive boy spoke at Tommy\\'s elbow: \"The young lady--she\\'s gone away by train, I think, sir,\" he murmured shyly. \"What?\" Tommy wheeled round upon him. The small boy became pinker than before. \"The taxi, sir. I heard her tell the driver Charing Cross and to look sharp.\" Tommy stared at him, his eyes opening wide in surprise. Emboldened, the small boy proceeded. \"So I thought, having asked for an A.B.C. and a Bradshaw.\" Tommy interrupted him: \"When did she ask for an A.B.C. and a Bradshaw?\" \"When I took her the telegram, sir.\" \"A telegram?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"When was that?\" \"About half-past twelve, sir.\" \"Tell me exactly what happened.\" The small boy drew a long breath. \"I took up a telegram to No. 891--the lady was there. She opened it and gave a gasp, and then she said, very jolly like: \\'Bring me up a Bradshaw, and an A.B.C., and look sharp, Henry.\\' My name isn\\'t Henry, but----\" \"Never mind your name,\" said Tommy impatiently. \"Go on.\" \"Yes, sir. I brought them, and she told me to wait, and looked up something. And then she looks up at the clock, and \\'Hurry up,\\' she says. \\'Tell them to get me a taxi,\\' and she begins a-shoving on of her hat in front of the glass, and she was down in two ticks, almost as quick as I was, and I seed her going down the steps and into the taxi, and I heard her call out what I told you.\" The small boy stopped and replenished his lungs. Tommy continued to stare at him. At that moment Julius rejoined him. He held an open letter in his hand. \"I say, Hersheimmer\"--Tommy turned to him--\"Tuppence has gone off sleuthing on her own.\" \"Shucks!\" \"Yes, she has. She went off in a taxi to Charing Cross in the deuce of a hurry after getting a telegram.\" His eye fell on the letter in Julius\\'s hand. \"Oh; she left a note for you. That\\'s all right. Where\\'s she off to?\" Almost unconsciously, he held out his hand for the letter, but Julius folded it up and placed it in his pocket. He seemed a trifle embarrassed. \"I guess this is nothing to do with it. It\\'s about something else--something I asked her that she was to let me know about.\" \"Oh!\" Tommy looked puzzled, and seemed waiting for more. \"See here,\" said Julius suddenly, \"I\\'d better put you wise. I asked Miss Tuppence to marry me this morning.\" \"Oh!\" said Tommy mechanically. He felt dazed. Julius\\'s words were totally unexpected. For the moment they benumbed his brain. \"I\\'d like to tell you,\" continued Julius, \"that before I suggested anything of the kind to Miss Tuppence, I made it clear that I didn\\'t want to butt in in any way between her and you----\" Tommy roused himself. \"That\\'s all right,\" he said quickly. \"Tuppence and I have been pals for years. Nothing more.\" He lit a cigarette with a hand that shook ever so little. \"That\\'s quite all right. Tuppence always said that she was looking out for----\" He stopped abruptly, his face crimsoning, but Julius was in no way discomposed. \"Oh, I guess it\\'ll be the dollars that\\'ll do the trick. Miss Tuppence put me wise to that right away. There\\'s no humbug about her. We ought to gee along together very well.\" Tommy looked at him curiously for a minute, as though he were about to speak, then changed his mind and said nothing. Tuppence and Julius! Well, why not? Had she not lamented the fact that she knew no rich men? Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance? Her meeting with the young American millionaire had given her the chance--and it was unlikely she would be slow to avail herself of it. She was out for money. She had always said so. Why blame her because she had been true to her creed? Nevertheless, Tommy did blame her. He was filled with a passionate and utterly illogical resentment. It was all very well to SAY things like that--but a REAL girl would never marry for money. Tuppence was utterly cold-blooded and selfish, and he would be delighted if he never saw her again! And it was a rotten world! Julius\\'s voice broke in on these meditations. \"Yes, we ought to get along together very well. I\\'ve heard that a girl always refuses you once--a sort of convention.\" Tommy caught his arm. \"Refuses? Did you say REFUSES?\" \"Sur \" \"Oh What does it mean See See \"A week! We\\'re no nearer to finding Tuppence, and NEXT SUNDAY IS THE 29TH!\" \"Shucks Scotland Yard for me Scotland Yard for me \"I thought you\\'d be sure to bring her along \"I thought you\\'d be sure to bring her along Would this man\\'s eyes have seen something where theirs had been blind?

The name of Jane Finn had not even been mentioned. The following morning a few brief words with Albert informed her that nothing was waiting for her at the stationer\\'s. It seemed incredible that Tommy, if all was well with him, should not send any word to her. A cold hand seemed to close round her heart.... Supposing... She choked her fears down bravely. It was no good worrying. But she leapt at a chance offered her by Mrs. Vandemeyer. \"What day do you usually go out, Prudence?\" \"Friday\\'s my usual day, ma\\'am.\" Mrs. Vandemeyer lifted her eyebrows. \"And to-day is Friday! But I suppose you hardly wish to go out to-day, as you only came yesterday.\" \"I was thinking of asking you if I might, ma\\'am.\" Mrs. Vandemeyer looked at her a minute longer, and then smiled. \"I wish Count Stepanov could hear you. He made a suggestion about you last night.\" Her smile broadened, catlike. \"Your request is very--typical. I am satisfied. You do not understand all this--but you can go out to-day. It makes no difference to me, as I shall not be dining at home.\" \"Thank you, ma\\'am.\" Tuppence felt a sensation of relief once she was out of the other\\'s presence. Once again she admitted to herself that she was afraid, horribly afraid, of the beautiful woman with the cruel eyes. In the midst of a final desultory polishing of her silver, Tuppence was disturbed by the ringing of the front door bell, and went to answer it. This time the visitor was neither Whittington nor Boris, but a man of striking appearance. Just a shade over average height, he nevertheless conveyed the impression of a big man. His face, clean-shaven and exquisitely mobile, was stamped with an expression of power and force far beyond the ordinary. Magnetism seemed to radiate from him. Tuppence was undecided for the moment whether to put him down as an actor or a lawyer, but her doubts were soon solved as he gave her his name: Sir James Peel Edgerton. She looked at him with renewed interest. This, then, was the famous K.C. whose name was familiar all over England. She had heard it said that he might one day be Prime Minister. He was known to have refused office in the interests of his profession, preferring to remain a simple Member for a Scotch constituency. Tuppence went back to her pantry thoughtfully. The great man had impressed her. She understood Boris\\'s agitation. Peel Edgerton would not be an easy man to deceive. In about a quarter of an hour the bell rang, and Tuppence repaired to the hall to show the visitor out. He had given her a piercing glance before. Now, as she handed him his hat and stick, she was conscious of his eyes raking her through. As she opened the door and stood aside to let him pass out, he stopped in the doorway. \"Not been doing this long, eh?\" Tuppence raised her eyes, astonished. She read in his glance kindliness, and something else more difficult to fathom. He nodded as though she had answered. \"V.A.D. and hard up, I suppose?\" \"Did Mrs. Vandemeyer tell you that?\" asked Tuppence suspiciously. \"No, child. The look of you told me. Good place here?\" \"Very good, thank you, sir.\" \"Ah, but there are plenty of good places nowadays. And a change does no harm sometimes.\" \"Do you mean----?\" began Tuppence. But Sir James was already on the topmost stair. He looked back with his kindly, shrewd glance. \"Just a hint,\" he said. \"That\\'s all.\" Tuppence went back to the pantry more thoughtful than ever. CHAPTER XI. JULIUS TELLS A STORY DRESSED appropriately, Tuppence duly sallied forth for her \"afternoon out.\" Albert was in temporary abeyance, but Tuppence went herself to the stationer\\'s to make quite sure that nothing had come for her. Satisfied on this point, she made her way to the Ritz. On inquiry she learnt that Tommy had not yet returned. It was the answer she had expected, but it was another nail in the coffin of her hopes. She resolved to appeal to Mr. Carter, telling him when and where Tommy had started on his quest, and asking him to do something to trace him. The prospect of his aid revived her mercurial spirits, and she next inquired for Julius Hersheimmer. The reply she got was to the effect that he had returned about half an hour ago, but had gone out immediately. Tuppence\\'s spirits revived still more. It would be something to see Julius. Perhaps he could devise some plan for finding out what had become of Tommy. She wrote her note to Mr. Carter in Julius\\'s sitting-room, and was just addressing the envelope when the door burst open. \"What the hell----\" began Julius, but checked himself abruptly. \"I beg your pardon, Miss Tuppence. Those fools down at the office would have it that Beresford wasn\\'t here any longer--hadn\\'t been here since Wednesday. Is that so?\" Tuppence nodded. \"You don\\'t know where he is?\" she asked faintly. \"I? How should I know? I haven\\'t had one darned word from him, though I wired him yesterday morning.\" \"I expect your wire\\'s at the office unopened.\" \"But where is he?\" \"I don\\'t know. I hoped you might.\" \"I tell you I haven\\'t had one darned word from him since we parted at the depot on Wednesday.\" \"What depot?\" \"Waterloo. Your London and South Western road.\" \"Waterloo?\" frowned Tuppence. \"Why, yes. Didn\\'t he tell you?\" \"I haven\\'t seen him either,\" replied Tuppence impatiently. \"Go on about Waterloo. What were you doing there?\" \"He gave me a call. Over the phone. Told me to get a move on, and hustle. Said he was trailing two crooks.\" \"Oh!\" said Tuppence, her eyes opening. \"I see. Go on.\" \"I hurried along right away. Beresford was there. He pointed out the crooks. The big on Boris\\'s words, \"I believe you would sell--us!\" and her answer, \"The price would have to be enormous,\" given lightly, it was true, yet might not there be a substratum of truth in it? Long ago, had not Whittington asked: \"Who\\'s been blabbing Boris\\'s words, \"I believe you would sell--us!\" and her answer, \"The price would have to be enormous,\" given lightly, it was true, yet might not there be a substratum of truth in it? Long ago, had not Whittington asked: \"Who\\'s been blabbing? Rita Boris\\'s words, \"I believe you would sell--us!\" and her answer, \"The price would have to be enormous,\" given lightly, it was true, yet might not there be a substratum of truth in it? Long ago, had not Whittington asked: \"Who\\'s been blabbing Boris\\'s words, \"I believe you would sell--us!\" and her answer, \"The price would have to be enormous,\" given lightly, it was true, yet might not there be a substratum of truth in it? Long ago, had not Whittington asked: \"Who\\'s been blabbing? Rita', 'Colombier': '\"Surely you are not thinking of refusing', 'Chicken Newberg': 'I have come into money, and the shock has been too much for me', 'Lobster': 'I have come into money, and the shock has been too much for me', 'Hurry': '\"Well, anyway, what ARE we going to do \"Well, anyway, what ARE we going to do I\\'m going to get busy after those papers, but I\\'ll be back in two shakes of a dog\\'s tail, and I\\'ll tote you up to London and give you the time of your young life before we go back to the States \"You have orders--from HIM?\" \"Naturally!

True, his question to Annette had proved that he was personally unacquainted with Jane Finn, but he had never pretended otherwise. The question now was, did Annette really know more? Were her denials intended primarily for the listeners? On that point he could come to no conclusion. But there was a more vital question that drove out all others. Could he, bound as he was, manage to cut his bonds? He essayed cautiously to rub the open blade up and down on the cord that bound his two wrists together. It was an awkward business, and drew a smothered \"Ow\" of pain from him as the knife cut into his wrist. But slowly and doggedly he went on sawing to and fro. He cut the flesh badly, but at last he felt the cord slacken. With his hands free, the rest was easy. Five minutes later he stood upright with some difficulty, owing to the cramp in his limbs. His first care was to bind up his bleeding wrist. Then he sat on the edge of the bed to think. Conrad had taken the key of the door, so he could expect little more assistance from Annette. The only outlet from the room was the door, consequently he would perforce have to wait until the two men returned to fetch him. But when they did... Tommy smiled! Moving with infinite caution in the dark room, he found and unhooked the famous picture. He felt an economical pleasure that his first plan would not be wasted. There was now nothing to do but to wait. He waited. The night passed slowly. Tommy lived through an eternity of hours, but at last he heard footsteps. He stood upright, drew a deep breath, and clutched the picture firmly. The door opened. A faint light streamed in from outside. Conrad went straight towards the gas to light it. Tommy deeply regretted that it was he who had entered first. It would have been pleasant to get even with Conrad. Number 14 followed. As he stepped across the threshold, Tommy brought the picture down with terrific force on his head. Number 14 went down amidst a stupendous crash of broken glass. In a minute Tommy had slipped out and pulled to the door. The key was in the lock. He turned it and withdrew it just as Conrad hurled himself against the door from the inside with a volley of curses. For a moment Tommy hesitated. There was the sound of some one stirring on the floor below. Then the German\\'s voice came up the stairs. \"Gott im Himmel! Conrad, what is it?\" Tommy felt a small hand thrust into his. Beside him stood Annette. She pointed up a rickety ladder that apparently led to some attics. \"Quick--up here!\" She dragged him after her up the ladder. In another moment they were standing in a dusty garret littered with lumber. Tommy looked round. \"This won\\'t do. It\\'s a regular trap. There\\'s no way out.\" \"Hush! Wait.\" The girl put her finger to her lips. She crept to the top of the ladder and listened. The banging and beating on the door was terrific. The German and another were trying to force the door in. Annette explained in a whisper: \"They will think you are still inside. They cannot hear what Conrad says. The door is too thick.\" \"I thought you could hear what went on in the room?\" \"There is a peep-hole into the next room. It was clever of you to guess. But they will not think of that--they are only anxious to get in.\" \"Yes--but look here----\" \"Leave it to me.\" She bent down. To his amazement, Tommy saw that she was fastening the end of a long piece of string to the handle of a big cracked jug. She arranged it carefully, then turned to Tommy. \"Have you the key of the door?\" \"Yes.\" \"Give it to me.\" He handed it to her. \"I am going down. Do you think you can go halfway, and then swing yourself down BEHIND the ladder, so that they will not see you?\" Tommy nodded. \"There\\'s a big cupboard in the shadow of the landing. Stand behind it. Take the end of this string in your hand. When I\\'ve let the others out--PULL!\" Before he had time to ask her anything more, she had flitted lightly down the ladder and was in the midst of the group with a loud cry: \"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Qu\\'est-ce qu\\'il y a?\" The German turned on her with an oath. \"Get out of this. Go to your room!\" Very cautiously Tommy swung himself down the back of the ladder. So long as they did not turn round... all was well. He crouched behind the cupboard. They were still between him and the stairs. \"AH!\" Annette appeared to stumble over something. She stooped. \"Mon Dieu, voila la clef!\" The German snatched it from her. He unlocked the door. Conrad stumbled out, swearing. \"Where is he? Have you got him?\" \"We have seen no one,\" said the German sharply. His face paled. \"Who do you mean?\" Conrad gave vent to another oath. \"He\\'s got away.\" \"Impossible. He would have passed us.\" At that moment, with an ecstatic smile Tommy pulled the string. A crash of crockery came from the attic above. In a trice the men were pushing each other up the rickety ladder and had disappeared into the darkness above. Quick as a flash Tommy leapt from his hiding-place and dashed down the stairs, pulling the girl with him. There was no one in the hall. He fumbled over the bolts and chain. At last they yielded, the door swung open. He turned. Annette had disappeared. Tommy stood spell-bound. Had she run upstairs again? What madness possessed her! He fumed with impatience, but he stood his ground. He would no Jane Finn at last Julius Hersheimmer Julius Hersheimmer Brown is JULIUS?

Between now and to-morrow morning. How could he know, even?\" \"You forget your own suggestion of a dictaphone,\" said Sir James dryly. \"We have a very formidable adversary. I believe, if we exercise all due care, that there is a very good chance of his being delivered into our hands. But we must neglect no precaution. We have an important witness, but she must be safeguarded. I would suggest that Miss Tuppence should go to bed, and that you and I, Mr. Hersheimmer, should share the vigil.\" Tuppence was about to protest, but happening to glance at the bed she saw Mrs. Vandemeyer, her eyes half-open, with such an expression of mingled fear and malevolence on her face that it quite froze the words on her lips. For a moment she wondered whether the faint and the heart attack had been a gigantic sham, but remembering the deadly pallor she could hardly credit the supposition. As she looked the expression disappeared as by magic, and Mrs. Vandemeyer lay inert and motionless as before. For a moment the girl fancied she must have dreamt it. But she determined nevertheless to be on the alert. \"Well,\" said Julius, \"I guess we\\'d better make a move out of here any way.\" The others fell in with his suggestion. Sir James again felt Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s pulse. \"Perfectly satisfactory,\" he said in a low voice to Tuppence. \"She\\'ll be absolutely all right after a night\\'s rest.\" The girl hesitated a moment by the bed. The intensity of the expression she had surprised had impressed her powerfully. Mrs. Vandemeyer lifted her lids. She seemed to be struggling to speak. Tuppence bent over her. \"Don\\'t--leave----\" she seemed unable to proceed, murmuring something that sounded like \"sleepy.\" Then she tried again. Tuppence bent lower still. It was only a breath. \"Mr.--Brown----\" The voice stopped. But the half-closed eyes seemed still to send an agonized message. Moved by a sudden impulse, the girl said quickly: \"I shan\\'t leave the flat. I shall sit up all night.\" A flash of relief showed before the lids descended once more. Apparently Mrs. Vandemeyer slept. But her words had awakened a new uneasiness in Tuppence. What had she meant by that low murmur: \"Mr. Brown?\" Tuppence caught herself nervously looking over her shoulder. The big wardrobe loomed up in a sinister fashion before her eyes. Plenty of room for a man to hide in that.... Half-ashamed of herself, Tuppence pulled it open and looked inside. No one--of course! She stooped down and looked under the bed. There was no other possible hiding-place. Tuppence gave her familiar shake of the shoulders. It was absurd, this giving way to nerves! Slowly she went out of the room. Julius and Sir James were talking in a low voice. Sir James turned to her. \"Lock the door on the outside, please, Miss Tuppence, and take out the key. There must be no chance of anyone entering that room.\" The gravity of his manner impressed them, and Tuppence felt less ashamed of her attack of \"nerves.\" \"Say,\" remarked Julius suddenly, \"there\\'s Tuppence\\'s bright boy. I guess I\\'d better go down and ease his young mind. That\\'s some lad, Tuppence.\" \"How did you get in, by the way?\" asked Tuppence suddenly. \"I forgot to ask.\" \"Well, Albert got me on the phone all right. I ran round for Sir James here, and we came right on. The boy was on the look out for us, and was just a mite worried about what might have happened to you. He\\'d been listening outside the door of the flat, but couldn\\'t hear anything. Anyhow he suggested sending us up in the coal lift instead of ringing the bell. And sure enough we landed in the scullery and came right along to find you. Albert\\'s still below, and must be just hopping mad by this time.\" With which Julius departed abruptly. \"Now then, Miss Tuppence,\" said Sir James, \"you know this place better than I do. Where do you suggest we should take up our quarters?\" Tuppence considered for a moment or two. \"I think Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s boudoir would be the most comfortable,\" she said at last, and led the way there. Sir James looked round approvingly. \"This will do very well, and now, my dear young lady, do go to bed and get some sleep.\" Tuppence shook her head resolutely. \"I couldn\\'t, thank you, Sir James. I should dream of Mr. Brown all night!\" \"But you\\'ll be so tired, child.\" \"No, I shan\\'t. I\\'d rather stay up--really.\" The lawyer gave in. Julius reappeared some minutes later, having reassured Albert and rewarded him lavishly for his services. Having in his turn failed to persuade Tuppence to go to bed, he said decisively: \"At any rate, you\\'ve got to have something to eat right away. Where\\'s the larder?\" Tuppence directed him, and he returned in a few minutes with a cold pie and three plates. After a hearty meal, the girl felt inclined to pooh-pooh her fancies of half an hour before. The power of the money bribe could not fail. \"And now, Miss Tuppence,\" said Sir James, \"we want to hear your adventures.\" \"That\\'s so,\" agreed Julius. Tuppence narrated her adventures with some complacence. Julius occasionally interjected an admiring \"Bully.\" Sir James said nothing until she had finished, when his quiet \"well done, Miss Tuppence,\" made her flush with pleasure. \"There\\'s one thing I don\\'t get clearly,\" said Julius. \"What put her up to clearing out?\" \"I don\\'t know,\" confessed Tuppence. Sir James stroked his chin thoughtfully. \"The room was in great disorder. That looks as though her flight was unpremeditated. Almost as though she got a sudden warning to go from some one.\" \"Mr. Brown, I suppose,\" said Julius scoffingly. The lawyer looked at him deliberately fo \"Didn\\'t he tell you he was coming up to town \"Who\\'s the other cup for I suppose we might call her that \"Who\\'s the other cup for I suppose we might call her that \"And what now Shall we say after a bath and breakfast \"And what now Shall we say after a bath and breakfast \" \"And the heart trouble?

The name of Jane Finn had not even been mentioned. The following morning a few brief words with Albert informed her that nothing was waiting for her at the stationer\\'s. It seemed incredible that Tommy, if all was well with him, should not send any word to her. A cold hand seemed to close round her heart.... Supposing... She choked her fears down bravely. It was no good worrying. But she leapt at a chance offered her by Mrs. Vandemeyer. \"What day do you usually go out, Prudence?\" \"Friday\\'s my usual day, ma\\'am.\" Mrs. Vandemeyer lifted her eyebrows. \"And to-day is Friday! But I suppose you hardly wish to go out to-day, as you only came yesterday.\" \"I was thinking of asking you if I might, ma\\'am.\" Mrs. Vandemeyer looked at her a minute longer, and then smiled. \"I wish Count Stepanov could hear you. He made a suggestion about you last night.\" Her smile broadened, catlike. \"Your request is very--typical. I am satisfied. You do not understand all this--but you can go out to-day. It makes no difference to me, as I shall not be dining at home.\" \"Thank you, ma\\'am.\" Tuppence felt a sensation of relief once she was out of the other\\'s presence. Once again she admitted to herself that she was afraid, horribly afraid, of the beautiful woman with the cruel eyes. In the midst of a final desultory polishing of her silver, Tuppence was disturbed by the ringing of the front door bell, and went to answer it. This time the visitor was neither Whittington nor Boris, but a man of striking appearance. Just a shade over average height, he nevertheless conveyed the impression of a big man. His face, clean-shaven and exquisitely mobile, was stamped with an expression of power and force far beyond the ordinary. Magnetism seemed to radiate from him. Tuppence was undecided for the moment whether to put him down as an actor or a lawyer, but her doubts were soon solved as he gave her his name: Sir James Peel Edgerton. She looked at him with renewed interest. This, then, was the famous K.C. whose name was familiar all over England. She had heard it said that he might one day be Prime Minister. He was known to have refused office in the interests of his profession, preferring to remain a simple Member for a Scotch constituency. Tuppence went back to her pantry thoughtfully. The great man had impressed her. She understood Boris\\'s agitation. Peel Edgerton would not be an easy man to deceive. In about a quarter of an hour the bell rang, and Tuppence repaired to the hall to show the visitor out. He had given her a piercing glance before. Now, as she handed him his hat and stick, she was conscious of his eyes raking her through. As she opened the door and stood aside to let him pass out, he stopped in the doorway. \"Not been doing this long, eh?\" Tuppence raised her eyes, astonished. She read in his glance kindliness, and something else more difficult to fathom. He nodded as though she had answered. \"V.A.D. and hard up, I suppose?\" \"Did Mrs. Vandemeyer tell you that?\" asked Tuppence suspiciously. \"No, child. The look of you told me. Good place here?\" \"Very good, thank you, sir.\" \"Ah, but there are plenty of good places nowadays. And a change does no harm sometimes.\" \"Do you mean----?\" began Tuppence. But Sir James was already on the topmost stair. He looked back with his kindly, shrewd glance. \"Just a hint,\" he said. \"That\\'s all.\" Tuppence went back to the pantry more thoughtful than ever. CHAPTER XI. JULIUS TELLS A STORY DRESSED appropriately, Tuppence duly sallied forth for her \"afternoon out.\" Albert was in temporary abeyance, but Tuppence went herself to the stationer\\'s to make quite sure that nothing had come for her. Satisfied on this point, she made her way to the Ritz. On inquiry she learnt that Tommy had not yet returned. It was the answer she had expected, but it was another nail in the coffin of her hopes. She resolved to appeal to Mr. Carter, telling him when and where Tommy had started on his quest, and asking him to do something to trace him. The prospect of his aid revived her mercurial spirits, and she next inquired for Julius Hersheimmer. The reply she got was to the effect that he had returned about half an hour ago, but had gone out immediately. Tuppence\\'s spirits revived still more. It would be something to see Julius. Perhaps he could devise some plan for finding out what had become of Tommy. She wrote her note to Mr. Carter in Julius\\'s sitting-room, and was just addressing the envelope when the door burst open. \"What the hell----\" began Julius, but checked himself abruptly. \"I beg your pardon, Miss Tuppence. Those fools down at the office would have it that Beresford wasn\\'t here any longer--hadn\\'t been here since Wednesday. Is that so?\" Tuppence nodded. \"You don\\'t know where he is?\" she asked faintly. \"I? How should I know? I haven\\'t had one darned word from him, though I wired him yesterday morning.\" \"I expect your wire\\'s at the office unopened.\" \"But where is he?\" \"I don\\'t know. I hoped you might.\" \"I tell you I haven\\'t had one darned word from him since we parted at the depot on Wednesday.\" \"What depot?\" \"Waterloo. Your London and South Western road.\" \"Waterloo?\" frowned Tuppence. \"Why, yes. Didn\\'t he tell you?\" \"I haven\\'t seen him either,\" replied Tuppence impatiently. \"Go on about Waterloo. What were you doing there?\" \"He gave me a call. Over the phone. Told me to get a move on, and hustle. Said he was trailing two crooks.\" \"Oh!\" said Tuppence, her eyes opening. \"I see. Go on.\" \"I hurried along right away. Beresford was there. He pointed out the crooks. The big on \" \"And why not', 'Albert': 'Vandemeyer! Ha! ha Vandemeyer! Ha! ha You know old man Rysdale Worth a million dollars!\" \"Lumme You get me Where was he? Why had no word of any kind come from him You won\\'t forget the names, will you \" \"What about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard reassured Albert and rewarded him lavishly for his services. Having in his turn failed to persuade Tuppence to go to bed, he said decisively: \"At any rate, you\\'ve got to have something to eat right away. Where\\'s the larder?\" Tuppence directed him, and he returned in a few minutes with a cold pie and three plates. After a hearty meal, the girl felt inclined to pooh-pooh her fancies of half an hour before. The power of the money bribe could not fail. \"And now, Miss Tuppence,\" said Sir James, \"we want to hear your adventures.\" \"That\\'s so,\" agreed Julius. Tuppence narrated her adventures with some complacence. Julius occasionally interjected an admiring \"Bully.\" Sir James said nothing until she had finished, when his quiet \"well done, Miss Tuppence,\" made her flush with pleasure. \"There\\'s one thing I don\\'t get clearly,\" said Julius. \"What put her up to clearing out?\" \"I don\\'t know,\" confessed Tuppence. Sir James stroked his chin thoughtfully. \"The room was in great disorder. That looks as though her flight was unpremeditated. Almost as though she got a sudden warning to go from some one.\" \"Mr. Brown, I suppose,\" said Julius scoffingly. The lawyer looked at him deliberately for a minute or two. \"Why not?\" he said. \"Remember, you yourself have once been worsted by him.\" Julius flushed with vexation. \"I feel just mad when I think of how I handed out Jane\\'s photograph to him like a lamb. Gee, if I ever lay hands on it again, I\\'ll freeze on to it like--like hell!\" \"That contingency is likely to be a remote one,\" said the other dryly. \"I guess you\\'re right,\" said Julius frankly. \"And, in any case, it\\'s the original I\\'m out after. Where do you think she can be, Sir James?\" The lawyer shook his head. \"Impossible to say. But I\\'ve a very good idea where she has been.\" \"You have? Where?\" Sir James smiled. \"At the scene of your nocturnal adventures, the Bournemouth nursing home.\" \"There? Impossible. I asked.\" \"No, my dear sir, you asked if anyone of the name of Jane Finn had been there. Now, if the girl had been placed there it would almost certainly be under an assumed name.\" \"Bully for you,\" cried Julius. \"I never thought of that!\" \"It was fairly obvious,\" said the other. \"Perhaps the doctor\\'s in it too,\" suggested Tuppence. Julius shook his head. \"I don\\'t think so. I took to him at once. No, I\\'m pretty sure Dr. Hall\\'s all right.\" \"Hall, did you say?\" asked Sir James. \"That is curious--really very curious.\" \"Why?\" demanded Tuppence. \"Because I happened to meet him this morning. I\\'ve known him slightly on and off for some years, and this morning I ran across him in the street. Staying at the Metropole, he told me.\" He turned to Julius. \"Didn\\'t he tell you he was coming up to town?\" Julius shook his head. \"Curious,\" mused Sir James. \"You did not mention his name this afternoon, or I would have suggested your going to him for further information with my card as introduction.\" \"I guess I\\'m a mutt,\" said Julius with unusual humility. \"I ought to have thought of the false name stunt.\" \"How could you think of anything after falling out of that tree?\" cried Tuppence. \"I\\'m sure anyone else would have been killed right off.\" \"Well, I guess it doesn\\'t matter now, anyway,\" said Julius. \"We\\'ve got Mrs. Vandemeyer on a string, and that\\'s all we need.\" \"Yes,\" said Tuppence, but there was a lack of assurance in her voice. A silence settled down over the party. Little by little the magic of the night began to gain a hold on them. There were sudden creaks of the furniture, imperceptible rustlings in the curtains. Suddenly Tuppence sprang up with a cry. \"I can\\'t help it. I know Mr. Brown\\'s somewhere in the flat! I can FEEL him.\" \"Sure, Tuppence, how could he be? This door\\'s open into the hall. No one could have come in by the front door without our seeing and hearing him.\" \"I can\\'t help it. I FEEL he\\'s here!\" She looked appealingly at Sir James, who replied gravely: \"With due deference to your feelings, Miss Tuppence (and mine as well for that matter), I do not see how it is humanly possible for anyone to be in the flat without our knowledge.\" The girl was a little comforted by his wards. \"Sitting up at night is always rather jumpy,\" she confessed. \"Yes,\" said Sir James. \"We are in the condition of people holding a seance. Perhaps if a medium were present we might get some marvellous results.\" \"Do you believe in spiritualism?\" asked Tuppence, opening her eyes wide. The lawyer shrugged his shoulders. \"There is some truth in it, without a doubt. But most of the testimony would not pass muster in the witness-box.\" The hours drew on. With the first faint glimmerings of dawn, Sir James drew aside the curtains. They beheld, what few Londoners see, the slow rising of the sun over the sleeping city. Somehow, with the coming of the light, the dreads and fancies of the past night seemed absurd. Tuppence\\'s spirits revived to the normal. \"Hooray!\" she said. \"It\\'s going to be a gorgeous day. And we shall find Tommy. And Jane Finn. And everything will be lovely. I shall ask Mr. Carter if I can\\'t be made a Dame!\" At seven o\\'clock Tuppence volunteered to go and make some tea. She returned with a tray, containing the teapot and four cups. \"Who\\'s the other cup for?\" inquired Julius. \"The prisoner, of course. I suppose we might call her that?\" \"Taking her tea seems a kind of anticlimax to last night,\" said Julius thoughtfully. \"Yes, it does,\" admitted Tuppence. \"But, anyway, here goes. Perhaps you\\'d both come, too, in case she springs on me, or anything. You see, we don\\'t know what mood she\\'ll wake up in.\" Sir James and Julius accompanied her to the door. \"Where\\'s the key? Oh \"Hope the young lady\\'s keeping well, sir \" \"In the Underworld?\" \"No, dash it all, in this world By the way, have you by any chance an aunt, a cousin, a grandmother, or any other suitable female relation who might be represented as being likely to kick the bucket It was one Tommy would have recognized anywhere!

He spoke impulsively: \"I wish you\\'d been there, sir, to go over the house \" \"How Brown, of course James was growing. There was a man who would unerringly ferret out Tuppence\\'s whereabouts. In the meantime Jane Finn! And suddenly a dread clutched at his heart. It seemed too easy.... Suppose they should find her dead... stricken down by the hand of Mr. Brown? In another minute he was laughing at these melodramatic fancies. The doctor held open the door of a room and they passed in. On the white bed, bandages round her head, lay the girl. Somehow the whole scene seemed unreal. It was so exactly what one expected that it gave the effect of being beautifully staged. The girl looked from one to the other of them with large wondering eyes. Sir James spoke first. \"Miss Finn,\" he said, \"this is your cousin, Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer.\" A faint flush flitted over the girl\\'s face, as Julius stepped forward and took her hand. \"How do, Cousin Jane?\" he said lightly. But Tommy caught the tremor in his voice. \"Are you really Uncle Hiram\\'s son?\" she asked wonderingly. Her voice, with the slight warmth of the Western accent, had an almost thrilling quality. It seemed vaguely familiar to Tommy, but he thrust the impression aside as impossible. \"Sure thing.\" \"We used to read about Uncle Hiram in the papers,\" continued the girl, in her low soft tones. \"But I never thought I\\'d meet you one day. Mother figured it out that Uncle Hiram would never get over being mad with her.\" \"The old man was like that,\" admitted Julius. \"But I guess the new generation\\'s sort of different. Got no use for the family feud business. First thing I thought about, soon as the war was over, was to come along and hunt you up.\" A shadow passed over the girl\\'s face. \"They\\'ve been telling me things--dreadful things--that my memory went, and that there are years I shall never know about--years lost out of my life.\" \"You didn\\'t realize that yourself?\" The girl\\'s eyes opened wide. \"Why, no. It seems to me as though it were no time since we were being hustled into those boats. I can see it all now.\" She closed her eyes with a shudder. Julius looked across at Sir James, who nodded. \"Don\\'t worry any. It isn\\'t worth it. Now, see here, Jane, there\\'s something we want to know about. There was a man aboard that boat with some mighty important papers on him, and the big guns in this country have got a notion that he passed on the goods to you. Is that so?\" The girl hesitated, her glance shifting to the other two. Julius understood. \"Mr. Beresford is commissioned by the British Government to get those papers back. Sir James Peel Edgerton is an English Member of Parliament, and might be a big gun in the Cabinet if he liked. It\\'s owing to him that we\\'ve ferreted you out at last. So you can go right ahead and tell us the whole story. Did Danvers give you the papers?\" \"Yes. He said they\\'d have a better chance with me, because they would save the women and children first.\" \"Just as we thought,\" said Sir James. \"He said they were very important--that they might make all the difference to the Allies. But, if it\\'s all so long ago, and the war\\'s over, what does it matter now?\" \"I guess history repeats itself, Jane. First there was a great hue and cry over those papers, then it all died down, and now the whole caboodle\\'s started all over again--for rather different reasons. Then you can hand them over to us right away?\" \"But I can\\'t.\" \"What?\" \"I haven\\'t got them.\" \"You--haven\\'t--got them?\" Julius punctuated the words with little pauses. \"No--I hid them.\" \"You hid them?\" \"Yes. I got uneasy. People seemed to be watching me. It scared me--badly.\" She put her hand to her head. \"It\\'s almost the last thing I remember before waking up in the hospital....\" \"Go on,\" said Sir James, in his quiet penetrating tones. \"What do you remember?\" She turned to him obediently. \"It was at Holyhead. I came that way--I don\\'t remember why....\" \"That doesn\\'t matter. Go on.\" \"In the confusion on the quay I slipped away. Nobody saw me. I took a car. Told the man to drive me out of the town. I watched when we got on the open road. No other car was following us. I saw a path at the side of the road. I told the man to wait.\" She paused, then went on. \"The path led to the cliff, and down to the sea between big yellow gorse bushes--they were like golden flames. I looked round. There wasn\\'t a soul in sight. But just level with my head there was a hole in the rock. It was quite small--I could only just get my hand in, but it went a long way back. I took the oilskin packet from round my neck and shoved it right in as far as I could. Then I tore off a bit of gorse--My! but it did prick--and plugged the hole with it so that you\\'d never guess there was a crevice of any kind there. Then I marked the place carefully in my own mind, so that I\\'d find it again. There was a queer boulder in the path just there--for all the world like a dog sitting up begging. Then I went back to the road. The car was waiting, and I drove back. I just caught the train. I was a bit ashamed of myself for fancying things maybe, but, by and by, I saw the man opposite me wink at a woman who was sitting next to me, and I felt scared again, and was glad the papers were safe. I went out in the corridor to get a little air. I thought I\\'d slip into another carriage. But the woman called me back, said I\\'d dropped something, and when I stooped to look, something seemed to hit me--here. Is it important to find out who he was \"But the bogus inspector? Inspector Brown?\" \"Ah Brown Brown is, don\\'t you Brown is JULIUS? Julius--my own cousin \" \"Was it Julius Hersheimmer who helped you to escape', 'Rita Vandemeyer': 'Boris\\'s words, \"I believe you would sell--us!\" and her answer, \"The price would have to be enormous,\" given lightly, it was true, yet might not there be a substratum of truth in it?

She spoke only in monosyllables. A kind of dark suspicion smouldered in her eyes. Tommy felt that if this solitary confinement went on much longer he would go mad. He gathered from Conrad that they were waiting for orders from \"Mr. Brown.\" Perhaps, thought Tommy, he was abroad or away, and they were obliged to wait for his return. But the evening of the third day brought a rude awakening. It was barely seven o\\'clock when he heard the tramp of footsteps outside in the passage. In another minute the door was flung open. Conrad entered. With him was the evil-looking Number 14. Tommy\\'s heart sank at the sight of them. \"Evenin\\', gov\\'nor,\" said the man with a leer. \"Got those ropes, mate?\" The silent Conrad produced a length of fine cord. The next minute Number 14\\'s hands, horribly dexterous, were winding the cord round his limbs, while Conrad held him down. \"What the devil----?\" began Tommy. But the slow, speechless grin of the silent Conrad froze the words on his lips. Number 14 proceeded deftly with his task. In another minute Tommy was a mere helpless bundle. Then at last Conrad spoke: \"Thought you\\'d bluffed us, did you? With what you knew, and what you didn\\'t know. Bargained with us! And all the time it was bluff! Bluff! You know less than a kitten. But your number\\'s up now all right, you b----swine.\" Tommy lay silent. There was nothing to say. He had failed. Somehow or other the omnipotent Mr. Brown had seen through his pretensions. Suddenly a thought occurred to him. \"A very good speech, Conrad,\" he said approvingly. \"But wherefore the bonds and fetters? Why not let this kind gentleman here cut my throat without delay?\" \"Garn,\" said Number 14 unexpectedly. \"Think we\\'re as green as to do you in here, and have the police nosing round? Not \\'alf! We\\'ve ordered the carriage for your lordship to-morrow mornin\\', but in the meantime we\\'re not taking any chances, see!\" \"Nothing,\" said Tommy, \"could be plainer than your words--unless it was your face.\" \"Stow it,\" said Number 14. \"With pleasure,\" replied Tommy. \"You\\'re making a sad mistake--but yours will be the loss.\" \"You don\\'t kid us that way again,\" said Number 14. \"Talking as though you were still at the blooming Ritz, aren\\'t you?\" Tommy made no reply. He was engaged in wondering how Mr. Brown had discovered his identity. He decided that Tuppence, in the throes of anxiety, had gone to the police, and that his disappearance having been made public the gang had not been slow to put two and two together. The two men departed and the door slammed. Tommy was left to his meditations. They were not pleasant ones. Already his limbs felt cramped and stiff. He was utterly helpless, and he could see no hope anywhere. About an hour had passed when he heard the key softly turned, and the door opened. It was Annette. Tommy\\'s heart beat a little faster. He had forgotten the girl. Was it possible that she had come to his help? Suddenly he heard Conrad\\'s voice: \"Come out of it, Annette. He doesn\\'t want any supper to-night.\" \"Oui, oui, je sais bien. But I must take the other tray. We need the things on it.\" \"Well, hurry up,\" growled Conrad. Without looking at Tommy the girl went over to the table, and picked up the tray. She raised a hand and turned out the light. \"Curse you\"--Conrad had come to the door--\"why did you do that?\" \"I always turn it out. You should have told me. Shall I relight it, Monsieur Conrad?\" \"No, come on out of it.\" \"Le beau petit monsieur,\" cried Annette, pausing by the bed in the darkness. \"You have tied him up well, hein? He is like a trussed chicken!\" The frank amusement in her tone jarred on the boy; but at that moment, to his amazement, he felt her hand running lightly over his bonds, and something small and cold was pressed into the palm of his hand. \"Come on, Annette.\" \"Mais me voila.\" The door shut. Tommy heard Conrad say: \"Lock it and give me the key.\" The footsteps died away. Tommy lay petrified with amazement. The object Annette had thrust into his hand was a small penknife, the blade open. From the way she had studiously avoided looking at him, and her action with the light, he came to the conclusion that the room was overlooked. There must be a peep-hole somewhere in the walls. Remembering how guarded she had always been in her manner, he saw that he had probably been under observation all the time. Had he said anything to give himself away? Hardly. He had revealed a wish to escape and a desire to find Jane Finn, but nothing that could have given a clue to his own identity. True, his question to Annette had proved that he was personally unacquainted with Jane Finn, but he had never pretended otherwise. The question now was, did Annette really know more? Were her denials intended primarily for the listeners? On that point he could come to no conclusion. But there was a more vital question that drove out all others. Could he, bound as he was, manage to cut his bonds? He essayed cautiously to rub the open blade up and down on the cord that bound his two wrists together. It was an awkward business, and drew a smothered \"Ow\" of pain from him as the knife cut into his wrist. But slowly and doggedly he went on sawing to and fro. He cut the flesh badly, but at last he felt the cord slacken. With his hands free, the rest was easy. Five minutes later he stood upright with some difficulty, owing to the cramp in his limbs. His first care was to bind up his bleeding wrist. Then he sat on the edge of the bed to think \"Got those ropes, mate Was it possible that she had come to his help \"Gott im Himmel \"Who do you mean \"Who do you mean', 'Lie': \"Now, I ask you, do I look as though I thought there were the least chance of your killing me And it mayn't be so at all\", 'Tommy Calmly': '\"Speak, you swine of an Englishman--speak', 'Calm': '\"Himmel!

Only three people touched that brandy--you, Miss Tuppence, I myself, and one other--Mr. Julius Hersheimmer!\" Jane Finn stirred and sat up, regarding the speaker with wide astonished eyes. \"At first, the thing seemed utterly impossible. Mr. Hersheimmer, as the son of a prominent millionaire, was a well-known figure in America. It seemed utterly impossible that he and Mr. Brown could be one and the same. But you cannot escape from the logic of facts. Since the thing was so--it must be accepted. Remember Mrs. Vandemeyer\\'s sudden and inexplicable agitation. Another proof, if proof was needed. \"I took an early opportunity of giving you a hint. From some words of Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s at Manchester, I gathered that you had understood and acted on that hint. Then I set to work to prove the impossible possible. Mr. Beresford rang me up and told me, what I had already suspected, that the photograph of Miss Jane Finn had never really been out of Mr. Hersheimmer\\'s possession----\" But the girl interrupted. Springing to her feet, she cried out angrily: \"What do you mean? What are you trying to suggest? That Mr. Brown is JULIUS? Julius--my own cousin!\" \"No, Miss Finn,\" said Sir James unexpectedly. \"Not your cousin. The man who calls himself Julius Hersheimmer is no relation to you whatsoever.\" CHAPTER XXVI. MR. BROWN SIR James\\'s words came like a bomb-shell. Both girls looked equally puzzled. The lawyer went across to his desk, and returned with a small newspaper cutting, which he handed to Jane. Tuppence read it over her shoulder. Mr. Carter would have recognized it. It referred to the mysterious man found dead in New York. \"As I was saying to Miss Tuppence,\" resumed the lawyer, \"I set to work to prove the impossible possible. The great stumbling-block was the undeniable fact that Julius Hersheimmer was not an assumed name. When I came across this paragraph my problem was solved. Julius Hersheimmer set out to discover what had become of his cousin. He went out West, where he obtained news of her and her photograph to aid him in his search. On the eve of his departure from New York he was set upon and murdered. His body was dressed in shabby clothes, and the face disfigured to prevent identification. Mr. Brown took his place. He sailed immediately for England. None of the real Hersheimmer\\'s friends or intimates saw him before he sailed--though indeed it would hardly have mattered if they had, the impersonation was so perfect. Since then he had been hand and glove with those sworn to hunt him down. Every secret of theirs has been known to him. Only once did he come near disaster. Mrs. Vandemeyer knew his secret. It was no part of his plan that that huge bribe should ever be offered to her. But for Miss Tuppence\\'s fortunate change of plan, she would have been far away from the flat when we arrived there. Exposure stared him in the face. He took a desperate step, trusting in his assumed character to avert suspicion. He nearly succeeded--but not quite.\" \"I can\\'t believe it,\" murmured Jane. \"He seemed so splendid.\" \"The real Julius Hersheimmer WAS a splendid fellow! And Mr. Brown is a consummate actor. But ask Miss Tuppence if she also has not had her suspicions.\" Jane turned mutely to Tuppence. The latter nodded. \"I didn\\'t want to say it, Jane--I knew it would hurt you. And, after all, I couldn\\'t be sure. I still don\\'t understand why, if he\\'s Mr. Brown, he rescued us.\" \"Was it Julius Hersheimmer who helped you to escape?\" Tuppence recounted to Sir James the exciting events of the evening, ending up: \"But I can\\'t see WHY!\" \"Can\\'t you? I can. So can young Beresford, by his actions. As a last hope Jane Finn was to be allowed to escape--and the escape must be managed so that she harbours no suspicions of its being a put-up job. They\\'re not averse to young Beresford\\'s being in the neighbourhood, and, if necessary, communicating with you. They\\'ll take care to get him out of the way at the right minute. Then Julius Hersheimmer dashes up and rescues you in true melodramatic style. Bullets fly--but don\\'t hit anybody. What would have happened next? You would have driven straight to the house in Soho and secured the document which Miss Finn would probably have entrusted to her cousin\\'s keeping. Or, if he conducted the search, he would have pretended to find the hiding-place already rifled. He would have had a dozen ways of dealing with the situation, but the result would have been the same. And I rather fancy some accident would have happened to both of you. You see, you know rather an inconvenient amount. That\\'s a rough outline. I admit I was caught napping; but somebody else wasn\\'t.\" \"Tommy,\" said Tuppence softly. \"Yes. Evidently when the right moment came to get rid of him--he was too sharp for them. All the same, I\\'m not too easy in my mind about him.\" \"Why?\" \"Because Julius Hersheimmer is Mr. Brown,\" said Sir James dryly. \"And it takes more than one man and a revolver to hold up Mr. Brown....\" Tuppence paled a little. \"What can we do?\" \"Nothing until we\\'ve been to the house in Soho. If Beresford has still got the upper hand, there\\'s nothing to fear. If otherwise, our enemy will come to find us, and he will not find us unprepared!\" From a drawer in the desk, he took a service revolver, and placed it in his coat pocket. \"Now we\\'re ready. I know better than even to suggest going without you, Miss Tuppence----\" \"I should think so indeed!\" \"But I do suggest that Miss Finn should remain here. She will be perfectly safe, and I am afraid she is absolutely worn out with all she has been through.\" But to Tuppence\\'s surprise Jane shook her head. \"No. I guess I\\'m goin', 'Julius Hersheimmer': '\" \"Why \" \"Why', 'Hersheimmer': '\" \"Why \" \"Why Carter\\'s offer of a Government job, or accept Julius\\'s invitation and take a richly remunerated post in America on his ranch', 'Absurd': 'Hark! what was that? A stealthy footstep on the stairs? There WAS some one in the house', 'William': '\"Ha', 'Savoy': 'England was saved', 'Tuppence Meekly': '\" \"Oh', 'Adventures': '\" \"Tuppence, you are the limit!\" \"It has been fun, hasn\\'t it, Tommy'}\n"
