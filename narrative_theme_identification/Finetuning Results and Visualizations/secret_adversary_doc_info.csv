The Lusitania had been struck by two torpedoes in succession and was sinking rapidly, while the boats were being launched with all possible speed. The women and children were being lined up awaiting their turn. Some still clung desperately to husbands and fathers; others clutched their children closely to their breasts. One girl stood alone, slightly apart from the rest. She was quite young, not more than eighteen. She did not seem afraid, and her grave, steadfast eyes looked straight ahead. ""I beg your pardon.""

""I\'ll try,"" said Wyllard with a certain hesitation; and Mrs. Hastings turned to her companion as they drove away. ""Why did he look at you before he answered me?"" she asked, and laughed, for there was just light enough left to show the colour in Agatha\'s cheek. ""Well,"" she added, ""I told Allen he was sure to be the first."" Agatha looked at her in evident bewilderment, but she nodded. ""Yes,"" she said, ""of course, I knew it would come. Everybody knows by now that you have fallen out with Gregory."" ""But, as I told you, I haven\'t fallen out with him."" ""Then you certainly haven\'t married him, and if you have said \'No\' to Harry Wyllard because you would sooner take Gregory after all, you\'re a singularly unwise young woman. Anyway, you\'ll have to meet him when he comes to supper. Allen\'s fond of a talk with Harry; I can\'t have him kept away."" ""I was a little afraid of that,"" said Agatha quietly. ""What makes the situation more difficult is that he told me he would ask me again."" Mrs. Hastings appeared thoughtful. ""In that case he will in all probability do it; but I don\'t think you need feel diffident about meeting him, especially as you can\'t help it. He\'ll wait and say nothing until he considers it advisable."" She changed the subject, and talked about other matters until they reached the homestead; but as the weeks went by Agatha found that what', 'dreaded. It certainly looked as if she had come to triumph over her rival\'s humiliation, but Sally made it clear that she acquitted her of that intention. ""Still,"" said Sally, ""I know that wasn\'t the reason, and I\'m not mad with--you. It hurts""--she made an abrupt movement--""but I know it\'s true."" She turned to Agatha suddenly. ""Why did you do it?"" ""I thought you might save Gregory, if I told you."" ""That was all?"" Sally looked at her with incredulous eyes. ""No,"" answered Agatha simply, ""that was only part. It did not seem right that Gregory should go against Wyllard\'s wishes, and gamble the Range away on the wheat market."" She admitted it without hesitation, for she realized now exactly what had animated her to seek this painful interview. She was fighting Wyllard\'s battle, and that fact sustained her. Sally winced. ""Yes"" she agreed, ""I guess you had to tell me. He was fond of you. One could be proud of that. Harry Wyllard never did anything low down and mean."" Agatha did not resent her candor. Although this was a thing she would scarcely have credited a little while ago, she saw that the girl felt the contrast between Gregory\'s character and that of the man whose place he had taken, and regretted it. Agatha\'s eyes became dim with unshed tears. ""Wyllard, they think, is dead,"" she said, in a low voice. ""You have Gregory still."" Sally looked at her with unveiled compassion, and Agatha did not shrink from', 'be proud of that. Harry Wyllard never did anything low down and mean."" Agatha did not resent her candour. Although this was a thing she would scarcely have credited a little while ago, she saw that the girl felt the contrast between her lover\'s character and that of the man whose place he had taken, and regretted it. Then Agatha\'s eyes grew a trifle hazy. ""Wyllard, they think, is dead,"" she said, in a low, strained voice. ""You have Gregory still."" Sally looked at her with unveiled compassion, and Agatha did not shrink from it. ""Yes,"" she said, with a simplicity that became her, ""and Gregory must have someone to--take care of him. I must do it if I can."" There was no doubt that Agatha was stirred. This half-taught girl\'s quiet acceptance of the burden that many women must carry once more made her almost ashamed. ""We will leave it to you,"" she said. Then it became evident that there was another side to Sally\'s character, for her manner changed, and the suggestive hardness crept back into her eyes. ""Well,"" she said, ""I\'d most been expecting something of this kind when I heard that man Edmonds was going to the Range. He has got a pull on Gregory, but he\'s surely not going to feel quite happy when I get hold of him."" She rose in another moment, and, saying nothing further, walked back towards the house, in front of which they came upon Mrs. Hastings.

There had been a hint of mystery about him which had appealed to her imagination. He spoke to no one. If anyone spoke to him he was quick to rebuff the overture. Also he had a nervous way of looking over his shoulder with a swift, suspicious glance. She noticed now that he was greatly agitated. There were beads of perspiration on his brow. He was evidently in a state of overmastering fear. And yet he did not strike her as the kind of man who would be afraid to meet death! ""Yes?"" Her grave eyes met his inquiringly. He stood looking at her with a kind of desperate irresolution. ""It must be!"" he muttered to himself. ""Yes--it is the only way."" Then aloud he said abruptly: ""You are an American?"" ""Yes."" ""A patriotic one?"" The girl flushed. ""I guess you've no right to ask such a thing! Of course I am!"" ""Don't be offended. You wouldn't be if you knew how much there was at stake. But I've got to trust some one--and it must be a woman."" ""Why?"" ""Because of 'women and children first.'"" He looked round and lowered his voice. ""I'm carrying papers--vitally important papers.

""I have never loved any one better."" ""And never will?"" ""How can I say? It seems to me that I haven\'t got the feeling that other girls have. I want some one to love me;--I do. I own that. I want to be first with some one; but I have never found the one yet that I cared for."" ""You had better wait till you find him,"" said he, raising himself up on his arm. ""Come, let us get up and go home. You have asked me for my advice, and I have given it you. Do not throw yourself away upon a man because other people ask you, and because you think you might as well oblige them and oblige him. If you do, you will soon live to repent it.

I love you so well that I have already taken you for better or for worse. I cannot change. My nature is too stubborn for such changes. Have you a word to say to comfort me?' She turned away her head, but did not answer him at once. 'Do you understand how much I am in need of comfort?' 'You can do very well without comfort from me.' 'No, indeed. I shall live, no doubt; but I shall not do very well. As it is, I am not doing at all well. I am becoming sour and moody, and ill at ease with my friends. I would have you believe me, at any rate, when I say I love you.' 'I suppose you mean something.' 'I mean a great deal, dear. I mean all that a man can mean. That is it. You hardly understand that I am serious to the extent of ecstatic joy on the one side, and utter indifference to the world on the other. I shall never give it up till I learn that you are to be married to some one else.' 'What can I say, Mr Carbury?' 'That you will love me.' 'But if I don't?' 'Say that you will try.'

I won't love him. No;--I'll hate him. But I must think of him. I'll marry that other man to spite him, and then, when he finds that we are rich, he'll be broken-hearted.'

If so, there will be danger. Have you the nerve to go through with it?"" The girl smiled. ""I'll go through with it all right. And I'm real proud to be chosen! What am I to do with them afterwards?"" ""Watch the newspapers! I'll advertise in the personal column of the Times, beginning 'Shipmate.' At the end of three days if there's nothing--well, you'll know I'm down and out.

""Good-bye. Good luck to you,"" he said in a louder tone. Her hand closed on the oilskin packet that had lain in his palm. The Lusitania settled with a more decided list to starboard. In answer to a quick command, the girl went forward to take her place in the boat. CHAPTER I. THE YOUNG ADVENTURERS, LTD. ""TOMMY, old thing!"" ""Tuppence, old bean!"" The two young people greeted each other affectionately, and momentarily blocked the Dover Street Tube exit in doing so. The adjective ""old"" was misleading.

""And Mr. Blatherwick,"" he asked, ""where was he all the time?"" ""Who?"" Wolfenden asked in surprise. ""Mr. Blatherwick--your father\'s secretary,"" Mr. Sabin repeated coolly; ""I understood you to say that his name was Blatherwick."" ""I don\'t remember mentioning his name at all,"" Wolfenden said, vaguely disturbed. Mr. Sabin addressed his ball with care and played it deliberately on to the green. Then he returned to the subject. ""I think that you must have done,"" he said suavely, ""or I should scarcely have known it. Was he in the room?"" ""All the time,"" Wolfenden answered. Mr. Sabin drew another little breath. ""He was there when the fellow bolted?"" Wolfenden nodded. ""Why did he not try to stop him?"" Wolfenden smiled. ""Physically,"" he remarked, ""it would have been an impossibility. Blatherwick is a small man and an exceedingly nervous one. He is an honest little fellow, but I am afraid he would not have shone in an encounter of that sort."" Mr. Sabin was on the point of asking another question, but Wolfenden interrupted him. He scarcely knew why, but he wanted to get away from the subject. He was sorry that he had ever broached it. ""Come,"" he said, ""we are talking too much. Let us play golf. I am sure I put you off that last stroke."" Mr. Sabin took the hint and was silent. They were on the eleventh green, and bordering it on the far side was an open road--the sea', 'said dryly, ""nothing whatever the matter with him, except that he is mad."" ""On the whole, I cannot say that I am surprised to hear it,"" Wolfenden remarked; ""but I certainly think that, considering the form his madness takes, you ought to protect yourself in some way."" Mr. Sabin shrugged his shoulders contemptuously. ""He can never hurt me. I carry a talisman which is proof against any attempt that he can make; but none the less, I must confess that your aid last night was very welcome."" ""I was very pleased to be of any service,"" Wolfenden said, ""especially,"" he added, glancing toward Mr. Sabin\'s niece, ""since it has given me the pleasure of your acquaintance."" A little thrill passed through him. Her delicately-curved lips were quivering as though with amusement, and her eyes had fallen; she had blushed slightly at that unwitting, ardent look of his. Mr. Sabin\'s cold voice recalled him to himself. ""I believe,"" he said, ""that I overheard your name correctly. It is Wolfenden, is it not?"" Wolfenden assented. ""I am sorry that I haven\'t a card,"" he said. ""That is my name."" Mr. Sabin looked at him curiously. ""Wolfenden is, I believe, the family name of the Deringhams? May I ask, are you any relation to Admiral Lord Deringham?"" Wolfenden was suddenly grave. ""Yes,"" he answered; ""he is my father. Did you ever meet him?"" Mr. Sabin shook his head. ""No, I have heard of him abroad; also, I believe, of the Countess of Deringham,', 'your aid last night. I was anxious to get away before any fuss was made, or I would have expressed my gratitude at the time in a more seemly fashion."" ""I hope,"" Wolfenden said, ""that you will not think it necessary to say anything more about it. I did what any one in my place would have done without a moment\'s hesitation.""

He could not make up his mind whether it was his duty to disclose the name of the man who had made this strange attempt. ""Your assailant was, I suppose, a stranger to you?"" he said slowly. Mr. Sabin shook his head. ""By no means. I recognised him directly. So, I believe, did you."" Wolfenden was honestly amazed. ""He was your guest, I believe,"" Mr. Sabin continued, ""until I entered the room. I saw him leave, and I was half-prepared for something of the sort.""

The girl assenting, they started walking down Dover Street towards Piccadilly. ""Now then,"" said Tommy, ""where shall we go?"" The very faint anxiety which underlay his tone did not escape the astute ears of Miss Prudence Cowley, known to her intimate friends for some mysterious reason as ""Tuppence."" She pounced at once.

There was no getting away, but she was very indignant. She tugged at her aunt's hand more than perhaps she knew, and there was something of a flouncing as she flung into the drawing-room and demanded--- 'Well, what have you been doing to poor little Val?' 'We have done nothing,' said Miss Mohun quietly. 'Miss Leverett wanted to ask her some questions. Sit down, Gillian. You had better hear what I have to say before going to her.

Tuppence had no claim to beauty, but there was character and charm in the elfin lines of her little face, with its determined chin and large, wide-apart grey eyes that looked mistily out from under straight, black brows.

But Rawdon Crawley rode out of the ranks of his company, and came up and shook hands heartily with Amelia, and said to Jos, ""Well, old boy, how are you?"" and stared in Mrs. O\'Dowd\'s face and at the black cock\'s feathers until she began to think she had made a conquest of him. George, who had been delayed behind, rode up almost immediately with Dobbin, and they touched their caps to the august personages, among whom Osborne at once perceived Mrs. Crawley. He was delighted to see Rawdon leaning over his carriage familiarly and talking to Amelia, and met the aide-de-camp\'s cordial greeting with more than corresponding warmth. The nods between Rawdon and Dobbin were of the very faintest specimens of politeness. Crawley told George where they were stopping with General Tufto at the Hotel du Parc, and George made his friend promise to come speedily to Osborne\'s own residence. ""Sorry I hadn\'t seen you three days ago,"" George said. ""Had a dinner at the Restaurateur\'s--rather a nice thing. Lord Bareacres, and the Countess, and Lady Blanche, were good enough to dine with us--wish we\'d had you."" Having thus let his friend know his claims to be a man of fashion, Osborne parted from Rawdon, who followed the august squadron down an alley into which they cantered, while George', 'have promised me, any time these hundred years?"" Dobbin said to his friend a few days after the night at the Opera. ""When do you intend to give up sermonising?"" was the other\'s reply. ""What the deuce, man, are you alarmed about? We play low; I won last night. You don\'t suppose Crawley cheats? With fair play it comes to pretty much the same thing at the year\'s end."" ""But I don\'t think he could pay if he lost,"" Dobbin said; and his advice met with the success which advice usually commands. Osborne and Crawley were repeatedly together now. General Tufto dined abroad almost constantly. George was always welcome in the apartments (very close indeed to those of the General) which the aide-de-camp and his wife occupied in the hotel. Amelia\'s manners were such when she and George visited Crawley and his wife at these quarters, that they had very nearly come to their first quarrel; that is, George scolded his wife violently for her evident unwillingness to go, and the high and mighty manner in which she comported herself towards Mrs. Crawley, her old friend; and Amelia did not say one single word in reply; but with her husband\'s eye upon her, and Rebecca scanning her as she felt, was, if possible, more bashful and awkward on the second visit which she paid to Mrs. Rawdon, than on her first call. Rebecca was doubly affectionate, of course, and would not take notice, in the least, of her friend\'s coolness.', 'said, as they drove away westward after the little interview. ""My dear Sharp, your young friend is charming. Send for her to Park Lane, do you hear?"" Miss Crawley had a good taste. She liked natural manners--a little timidity only set them off. She liked pretty faces near her; as she liked pretty pictures and nice china. She talked of Amelia with rapture half a dozen times that day. She mentioned her to Rawdon Crawley, who came dutifully to partake of his aunt\'s chicken. Of course, on this Rebecca instantly stated that Amelia was engaged to be married--to a Lieutenant Osborne--a very old flame. ""Is he a man in a line-regiment?"" Captain Crawley asked, remembering after an effort, as became a guardsman, the number of the regiment, the --th. Rebecca thought that was the regiment. ""The Captain\'s name,"" she said, ""was Captain Dobbin."" ""A lanky gawky fellow,"" said Crawley, ""tumbles over everybody.

Captain Rawdon Crawley burst into a horse-laugh by way of reply; and being pressed by the ladies to explain, did so when the explosion of hilarity was over. ""He fancies he can play at billiards,"" said he. ""I won two hundred of him at the Cocoa-Tree. HE play, the young flat!

'It is a very philosophical one,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'But breakfast is waiting, Mr. Magnus. Come.' Down they sat to breakfast, but it was evident, notwithstanding the boasting of Mr. Peter Magnus, that he laboured under a very considerable degree of nervousness, of which loss of appetite, a propensity to upset the tea-things, a spectral attempt at drollery, and an irresistible inclination to look at the clock, every other second, were among the principal symptoms.

WHITTINGTON'S OFFER TUPPENCE turned sharply, but the words hovering on the tip of her tongue remained unspoken, for the man's appearance and manner did not bear out her first and most natural assumption. She hesitated. As if he read her thoughts, the man said quickly: ""I can assure you I mean no disrespect."" Tuppence believed him. Although she disliked and distrusted him instinctively, she was inclined to acquit him of the particular motive which she had at first attributed to him. She looked him up and down. He was a big man, clean shaven, with a heavy jowl. His eyes were small and cunning, and shifted their glance under her direct gaze. ""Well, what is it?"" she asked. The man smiled. ""I happened to overhear part of your conversation with the young gentleman in Lyons'."" ""Well--what of it?"" ""Nothing--except that I think I may be of some use to you."" Another inference forced itself into Tuppence's mind: ""You followed me here?"" ""I took that liberty."" ""And in what way do you think you could be of use to me?"" The man took a card from his pocket and handed it to her with a bow. Tuppence took it and scrutinized it carefully. It bore the inscription, ""Mr. Edward Whittington."" Below the name were the words ""Esthonia Glassware Co.,"" and the address of a city office. Mr. Whittington spoke again: ""If you will call upon me to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock, I will lay the details of",157,Interaction between characters in a mystery story,157_sabin_sabins_wolfenden_wolfendens,"['sabin', 'sabins', 'wolfenden', 'wolfendens', 'murmured', 'countess', 'whitlett', 'shrugged', 'remarked', 'blatherwick']","['odd, but Mr. Sabin seemed positively relieved. ""And Mr. Blatherwick,"" he asked, ""where was he all the time?"" ""Who?"" Wolfenden asked in surprise. ""Mr. Blatherwick--your father\'s secretary,"" Mr. Sabin repeated coolly; ""I understood you to say that his name was Blatherwick."" ""I don\'t remember mentioning his name at all,"" Wolfenden said, vaguely disturbed. Mr. Sabin addressed his ball with care and played it deliberately on to the green. Then he returned to the subject. ""I think that you must have done,"" he said suavely, ""or I should scarcely have known it. Was he in the room?"" ""All the time,"" Wolfenden answered. Mr. Sabin drew another little breath. ""He was there when the fellow bolted?"" Wolfenden nodded. ""Why did he not try to stop him?"" Wolfenden smiled. ""Physically,"" he remarked, ""it would have been an impossibility. Blatherwick is a small man and an exceedingly nervous one. He is an honest little fellow, but I am afraid he would not have shone in an encounter of that sort."" Mr. Sabin was on the point of asking another question, but Wolfenden interrupted him. He scarcely knew why, but he wanted to get away from the subject. He was sorry that he had ever broached it. ""Come,"" he said, ""we are talking too much. Let us play golf. I am sure I put you off that last stroke."" Mr. Sabin took the hint and was silent. They were on the eleventh green, and bordering it on the far side was an open road--the sea', 'said dryly, ""nothing whatever the matter with him, except that he is mad."" ""On the whole, I cannot say that I am surprised to hear it,"" Wolfenden remarked; ""but I certainly think that, considering the form his madness takes, you ought to protect yourself in some way."" Mr. Sabin shrugged his shoulders contemptuously. ""He can never hurt me. I carry a talisman which is proof against any attempt that he can make; but none the less, I must confess that your aid last night was very welcome."" ""I was very pleased to be of any service,"" Wolfenden said, ""especially,"" he added, glancing toward Mr. Sabin\'s niece, ""since it has given me the pleasure of your acquaintance."" A little thrill passed through him. Her delicately-curved lips were quivering as though with amusement, and her eyes had fallen; she had blushed slightly at that unwitting, ardent look of his. Mr. Sabin\'s cold voice recalled him to himself. ""I believe,"" he said, ""that I overheard your name correctly. It is Wolfenden, is it not?"" Wolfenden assented. ""I am sorry that I haven\'t a card,"" he said. ""That is my name."" Mr. Sabin looked at him curiously. ""Wolfenden is, I believe, the family name of the Deringhams? May I ask, are you any relation to Admiral Lord Deringham?"" Wolfenden was suddenly grave. ""Yes,"" he answered; ""he is my father. Did you ever meet him?"" Mr. Sabin shook his head. ""No, I have heard of him abroad; also, I believe, of the Countess of Deringham,', 'your aid last night. I was anxious to get away before any fuss was made, or I would have expressed my gratitude at the time in a more seemly fashion."" ""I hope,"" Wolfenden said, ""that you will not think it necessary to say anything more about it. I did what any one in my place would have done without a moment\'s hesitation."" ""I am not quite so sure of that,"" Mr. Sabin said. ""But by the bye, can you tell me what became of the fellow? Did any one go after him?"" ""There was some sort of pursuit, I believe,"" Wolfenden said slowly, ""but he was not caught."" ""I am glad to hear it,"" Mr. Sabin said. Wolfenden looked at him in some surprise. He could not make up his mind whether it was his duty to disclose the name of the man who had made this strange attempt. ""Your assailant was, I suppose, a stranger to you?"" he said slowly. Mr. Sabin shook his head. ""By no means. I recognised him directly. So, I believe, did you."" Wolfenden was honestly amazed. ""He was your guest, I believe,"" Mr. Sabin continued, ""until I entered the room. I saw him leave, and I was half-prepared for something of the sort."" ""He was my guest, it is true, but none the less, he was a stranger to me,"" Wolfenden explained. ""He brought a letter from my cousin, who seems to have considered him a decent sort of fellow.""

I'll be there."" ""Thank you. Good evening."" He raised his hat with a flourish, and walked away. Tuppence remained for some minutes gazing after him. Then she gave a curious movement of her shoulders, rather as a terrier shakes himself. ""The adventures have begun,"" she murmured to herself. ""What does he want me to do, I wonder? There's something about you, Mr. Whittington, that I don't like at all. But, on the other hand, I'm not the least bit afraid of you. And as I've said before, and shall doubtless say again, little Tuppence can look after herself, thank you!"" And with a short, sharp nod of her head she walked briskly onward. As a result of further meditations, however, she turned aside from the direct route and entered a post office. There she pondered for some moments, a telegraph form in her hand. The thought of a possible five shillings spent unnecessarily spurred her to action, and she decided to risk the waste of ninepence. Disdaining the spiky pen and thick, black treacle which a beneficent Government had provided, Tuppence drew out Tommy's pencil which she had retained and wrote rapidly: ""Don't put in advertisement. Will explain to-morrow."" She addressed it to Tommy at his club, from which in one short month he would have to resign, unless a kindly fortune permitted him to renew his subscription. ""It may",61,Geoffrey Delamayn and family interactions,61_geoffrey_geoffreys_davies_elizabeth,"['geoffrey', 'geoffreys', 'davies', 'elizabeth', 'anne', 'blanche', 'mrs', 'owen', 'croft', 'blanches']","['to pursue that inquiry, my dear, with nothing better than Mrs. Inchbare\'s description to help us."" Blanche looked round at the sleeping Geoffrey. ""And _he_ knows!"" she said. ""It\'s maddening, uncle, to look at the brute snoring in his chair!"" Sir Patrick held up a warning hand. Before a word more could be said between them they were silenced again by another interruption. The whist-party comprised Lady Lundie and the surgeon, playing as partners against Smith and Jones. Arnold sat behind the surgeon, taking a lesson in the game. One, Two, and Three, thus left to their own devices, naturally thought of the billiard-table; and, detecting Geoffrey asleep in his corner, advanced to disturb his slumbers, under the all-sufficing apology of ""Pool."" Geoffrey roused himself, and rubbed his eyes, and said, drowsily, ""All right."" As he rose, he looked at the opposite corner in which Sir Patrick and his niece were sitting. Blanche\'s self-possession, resolutely as she struggled to preserve it, was not strong enough to keep her eyes from turning toward Geoffrey with an expression which betrayed the reluctant interest that she now felt in him. He stopped, noticing something entirely new in the look with which the young lady was regarding him. ""Beg your pardon,"" said Geoffrey. ""Do you wish to speak to me?"" Blanche\'s face flushed all over. Her uncle came to the rescue. ""Miss Lundie and I hope you have slept well Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick, jocosely. ""That\'s all."" ""Oh? That\'s all?"" said Geoffrey still', 'looked like himself again. ""Why go indoors this lovely weather?"" he said. ""Suppose we take a turn in the garden?"" Blanche pressed Anne\'s hand significantly. The proposal was evidently made for a purpose. They turned the corner of the cottage and gained the large garden at the back--the two ladies walking together, arm in arm; Sir Patrick and Geoffrey following them. Little by little, Blanche quickened her pace. ""I have got my instructions,"" she whispered to Anne. ""Let\'s get out of his hearing."" It was more easily said than done. Geoffrey kept close behind them. ""Consider my lameness, Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick. ""Not quite so fast."" It was well intended. But Geoffrey\'s cunning had taken the alarm. Instead of dropping behind with Sir Patrick, he called to his wife. ""Consider Sir Patrick\'s lameness,"" he repeated. ""Not quite so fast."" Sir Patrick met that check with characteristic readiness. When Anne slackened her pace, he addressed himself to Geoffrey, stopping deliberately in the middle of the path. ""Let me give you my message from Holchester House,"" he said. The two ladies were still slowly walking on. Geoffrey was placed between the alternatives of staying with Sir Patrick and leaving them by themselves--or of following them and leaving Sir Patrick. Deliberately, on his side, he followed the ladies. Sir Patrick called him back. ""I told you I wished to speak to you,"" he said, sharply. Driven to bay, Geoffrey openly revealed his resolution to give Blanche no opportunity of speaking in private', 'look at Anne. The look was not returned--was not even seen. From the moment when she had taken her place by Sir Patrick, Anne\'s eyes had rested on Blanche. They never moved--they never for an instant lost their tender sadness--when the woman who hated her spoke. All that was beautiful and true in that noble nature seemed to find its one sufficient encouragement in Blanche. As she looked once more at the sister of the unforgotten days of old, its native beauty of expression shone out again in her worn and weary face. Every man in the room (but Geoffrey) looked at her; and every man (but Geoffrey) felt for her. Sir Patrick addressed a second question to his sister-in-law. ""Is there any one here to represent the interests of Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn?"" he asked. Lady Lundie referred Sir Patrick to Geoffrey himself. Without looking up, Geoffrey motioned with his big brown hand to Mr. Moy, sitting by his side. Mr. Moy (holding the legal rank in Scotland which corresponds to the rank held by solicitors in England) rose and bowed to Sir Patrick, with the courtesy due to a man eminent in his time at the Scottish Bar. ""I represent Mr. Delamayn,"" he said. ""I congratulate myself, Sir Patrick, on having your ability and experience to appeal to in the conduct of the pending inquiry."" Sir Patrick returned the compliment as well as the bow. ""It is I who should learn from you,"" he answered.

After handing it over the counter she set out briskly for home, stopping at a baker's to buy three penny-worth of new buns. Later, in her tiny cubicle at the top of the house she munched buns and reflected on the future. What was the Esthonia Glassware Co., and what earthly need could it have for her services? A pleasurable thrill of excitement made Tuppence tingle. At any rate, the country vicarage had retreated into the background again. The morrow held possibilities. It was a long time before Tuppence went to sleep that night, and, when at length she did, she dreamed that Mr. Whittington had set her to washing up a pile of Esthonia Glassware, which bore an unaccountable resemblance to hospital plates! It wanted some five minutes to eleven when Tuppence reached the block of buildings in which the offices of the Esthonia Glassware Co. were situated. To arrive before the time would look over-eager. So Tuppence decided to walk to the end of the street and back again. She did so. On the stroke of eleven she plunged into the recesses of the building. The Esthonia Glassware Co. was on the top floor. There was a lift, but Tuppence chose to walk up. Slightly out of breath, she came to a halt outside the ground glass door with the legend painted across it ""Esthonia Glassware Co."" Tuppence knocked. In response to a voice from within, she turned the handle",162,Somerset's encounter with Paula and Captain De Stancy,162_somersets_somerset_murmured_stancys,"['somersets', 'somerset', 'murmured', 'stancys', 'mrs', 'stancy', 'paula', 'paulas', 'aunt', 'dare']","[""he beheld De Stancy, and De Stancy's sister beyond him. It was one of those gratuitous encounters which only happen to discarded lovers who have shown commendable stoicism under disappointment, as if on purpose to reopen and aggravate their wounds. It seemed as if the intervening traveller had met the other party by accident there and then. In a minute he turned and recognized Somerset, and by degrees the young men's cursory remarks to each other developed into a pretty regular conversation, interrupted only when he turned to speak to Paula on his left hand. 'Your architectural adviser travels in your party: how very convenient,' said the young tourist to her. 'Far pleasanter than having a medical attendant in one's train!' Somerset, who had no distractions on the other side of him, could hear every word of this. He glanced at Paula. She had not known of his presence in the room till now. Their eyes met for a second, and she bowed sedately. Somerset returned her bow, and her eyes were quickly withdrawn with scarcely visible confusion. 'Mr. Somerset is not travelling with us,' she said. 'We have met by accident. Mr. Somerset came to me on business a little while ago.' 'I must congratulate you on having put the castle into good hands,' continued the enthusiastic young man. 'I believe Mr. Somerset is quite competent,' said Paula stiffly. To include Somerset in the conversation the young man turned to him and added: 'You carry on your work at"", ""origin, as may be guessed, in Captain De Stancy's journey in the same direction, whom he had followed, and troubled with persistent request for more funds, carefully keeping out of sight of Paula and the rest. His dream of involving Paula in the De Stancy pedigree knew no abatement. But Somerset had lighted upon him at an instant when that idea, though not displaced, was overwhelmed by a rage for play. In hope of being able to continue it by Somerset's aid he was prepared to do almost anything to please the architect. 'You asked me,' said Dare, stroking his impassive brow, 'if I had seen anything of the Powers. I have seen them; and if I can be of any use to you in giving information about them I shall only be too glad.' 'What information can you give?' 'I can tell you where they are gone to.' 'Where?'

""Will you come this way, please."" He crossed to a partition door with ""Private"" on it, knocked, then opened the door and stood aside to let her pass in. Mr. Whittington was seated behind a large desk covered with papers. Tuppence felt her previous judgment confirmed. There was something wrong about Mr. Whittington. The combination of his sleek prosperity and his shifty eye was not attractive. He looked up and nodded. ""So you've turned up all right? That's good. Sit down, will you?"" Tuppence sat down on the chair facing him. She looked particularly small and demure this morning. She sat there meekly with downcast eyes whilst Mr. Whittington sorted and rustled amongst his papers. Finally he pushed them away, and leaned over the desk. ""Now, my dear young lady, let us come to business."" His large face broadened into a smile. ""You want work? Well, I have work to offer you. What should you say now to L100 down, and all expenses paid?"" Mr. Whittington leaned back in his chair, and thrust his thumbs into the arm-holes of his waistcoat. Tuppence eyed him warily. ""And the nature of the work?"" she demanded. ""Nominal--purely nominal. A pleasant trip, that is all."" ""Where to?"" Mr. Whittington smiled again. ""Paris.""

'I believe it is, Sir,' said Mr. Peter Magnus. 'I am very confident, Sir. Really, Mr. Pickwick, I do not see why a man should feel any fear in such a case as this, sir. What is it, Sir? There's nothing to be ashamed of; it's a matter of mutual accommodation, nothing more. Husband on one side, wife on the other. That's my view of the matter, Mr. Pickwick.' 'It is a very philosophical one,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'But breakfast is waiting, Mr. Magnus. Come.' Down they sat to breakfast, but it was evident, notwithstanding the boasting of Mr. Peter Magnus, that he laboured under a very considerable degree of nervousness, of which loss of appetite, a propensity to upset the tea-things, a spectral attempt at drollery, and an irresistible inclination to look at the clock, every other second, were among the principal symptoms. 'He-he-he,'tittered Mr. Magnus, affecting cheerfulness, and gasping with agitation. 'It only wants two minutes, Mr. Pickwick. Am I pale, Sir?' 'Not very,' replied Mr. Pickwick. There was a brief pause. 'I beg your pardon, Mr. Pickwick; but have you ever done this sort of thing in your time?' said Mr. Magnus. 'You mean proposing?' said Mr. Pickwick. 'Yes.'

'Dear, dear,' exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, who had been evidently roused by his friend's appeal; 'what an annoyance that door is! Who is that?' 'Me, Sir,' replied Sam Weller, putting in his head. 'I can't speak to you just now, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'I am engaged at this moment, Sam.' 'Beg your pardon, Sir,' rejoined Mr. Weller. 'But here's a lady here, Sir, as says she's somethin' wery partickler to disclose.' 'I can't see any lady,' replied Mr. Pickwick, whose mind was filled with visions of Mrs. Bardell. 'I wouldn't make too sure o' that, Sir,' urged Mr. Weller, shaking his head.

'Who is it?' inquired Mr. Pickwick. 'Will you see her, Sir?' asked Mr. Weller, holding the door in his hand as if he had some curious live animal on the other side.

Thus, for the second time, did Mr. Pickwick's innate good-feeling involve him in an enterprise from which he would most willingly have stood aloof. 'What is the name of the house?' inquired Mr. Pickwick. 'Westgate House, Sir.

""Mademoiselle,"" I answered, ""with the same inducement, yes!"" ""Monsieur has learned how to flatter,"" she remarked. ""It is an accomplishment which I never mastered,"" I declared. She sighed. All the time I knew quite well that she carried on this little war of words impatiently. There were other things of which she desired to speak. ""Tell me, monsieur,"" she said, ""what had he done to you, this man Tapilow?"" I shook my head. ""You must forgive me,"" I said. ""That is between him and me."" ""And Monsieur Louis,"" she murmured. ""Louis knew nothing about it,"" I declared. She seemed perplexed. She had evidently made up her mind that Louis had taken me there with the object of meeting Tapilow, and for some reason the truth was interesting to her.

""Whither are you going?"" he asked. ""Away, Monsieur,"" she answered. ""I was realising that my journey had indeed been in vain."" He looked at her a second in silence. Then stepping forward: ""Mademoiselle,"" he said, very quietly, ""your arguments have prevailed, and it shall be as you desire. The ci-devant Vicomte d\'Ombreval shall go free."" Her face seemed to grow of a sudden paler, and for an instant she stood still as if robbed of understanding. Then she came forward with hands outheld. ""Said I not that you were good and generous? Said I not that you could be noble, Monsieur?"" she cried, as she caught his resisting hand and sought to carry it to her lips. ""God will bless you, Monsieur--"" He drew his hand away, but without roughness. ""Let us say no more, Mademoiselle,"" he begged. ""But I will,"" she answered him. ""I am not without heart, Monsieur, and now that you have given me this proof of the deep quality of your love, I--"" She paused, as', 'she shall run no further risks.

Having concluded, Monsieur de Garnache sat back in his chair, and threw one leg over the other, fixing his eyes upon the Seneschal\'s face and awaiting his reply.

The terms are almost too liberal, Mr. Whittington. I cannot see any way in which I can be worth that amount of money to you."" ""No?"" said Whittington softly. ""Well, I will tell you. I could doubtless obtain some one else for very much less. What I am willing to pay for is a young lady with sufficient intelligence and presence of mind to sustain her part well, and also one who will have sufficient discretion not to ask too many questions."" Tuppence smiled a little. She felt that Whittington had scored. ""There's another thing. So far there has been no mention of Mr. Beresford. Where does he come in?"" ""Mr. Beresford?""

Mr. Crawley had now made up his mind that as long as it was possible he would ignore the presence of Mrs. Proudie altogether; and, therefore, he made no sign that he had heard the latter remark. ""It has been most unfortunate,"" continued the bishop. ""I have never before had a clergyman in my diocese placed in so distressing a position."" ""That is a matter of opinion, my lord,"" said Mr. Crawley, who at that moment thought of a crisis which had come in the life of another clergyman in the diocese of Barchester, with the circumstances of which he had by chance been made acquainted. ""Exactly,"" said the bishop. ""And I am expressing my opinion."" Mr. Crawley, who understood fighting, did not think that the time had yet come for striking a blow, so he simply bowed again. ""A most unfortunate position, Mr. Crawley,"" continued the bishop. ""Far be it from me to express an opinion upon the matter, which will have to come before a jury of your countrymen. It is enough for me to know that the magistrates assembled at Silverbridge, gentlemen to whom no doubt you must be known, as most of them live in your neighbourhood, have heard evidence upon the subject--"" ""Most convincing evidence,"" said Mrs. Proudie, interrupting her husband.

He, as well as others at Barchester, regretted that a man should be sent among them who, they were aware, was not of their way of thinking; but Mr. Harding himself was not a bigoted man on points of church doctrine, and he was quite prepared to welcome Dr. Proudie to Barchester in a graceful and becoming manner. He had nothing to seek and nothing to fear; he felt that it behoved him to be on good terms with his bishop, and he did not anticipate any obstacle that would prevent it. In such a frame of mind he proceeded to pay his respects at the palace the second day after the arrival of the bishop and his chaplain. But he did not go alone. Dr. Grantly proposed to accompany him, and Mr. Harding was not sorry to have a companion, who would remove from his shoulders the burden of the conversation in such an interview. In the affair of the consecration Dr. Grantly had been introduced to the bishop, and Mr. Harding had also been there. He had, however, kept himself in the background, and he was now to be presented to the great man for the first time. The archdeacon's feelings were of a much stronger nature.

So at least the archdeacon thought; though, to speak sooth, not he, but circumstances, had trampled on Mr. Slope. But the satisfaction of Mr. Harding was, of all, perhaps, the most complete. He laid aside his usual melancholy manner and brought forth little quiet jokes from the inmost mirth of his heart; he poked his fun at the archdeacon about Mr. Slope's marriage and quizzed him for his improper love for Mrs. Proudie. On the following day they all returned to Barchester. It was arranged that Mr. Arabin should know nothing of what had been done till he received the minister's letter from the hands of his embryo father-in-law. In order that no time might be lost, a message had been sent to him by the preceding night's post, begging him to be at the deanery at the hour that the train from London arrived. There was nothing in this which surprised Mr. Arabin.

Slowly the color dried out of face and neck, and she was as pale as before--with that almost withered paleness which is seen after a painful flush. At last she said--without turning toward him--in a low, measured voice, as if she were only thinking aloud in preparation for future speech-- ""But _can_ you marry?"" ""Yes,"" said Deronda, also in a low voice. ""I am going to marry.""

How could Pendennis have got all those private letters, etc., but that the Colonel kept them in a teak box, which Clive inherited and made over to his friend?

So far she had fooled Whittington with complete success, but to mention a palpably impossible sum might awaken his suspicions. An idea flashed across her brain. ""Suppose we say a little something down, and a fuller discussion of the matter later?"" Whittington gave her an ugly glance. ""Blackmail, eh?"" Tuppence smiled sweetly. ""Oh no! Shall we say payment of services in advance?"" Whittington grunted. ""You see,"" explained Tuppence still sweetly, ""I'm so very fond of money!"" ""You're about the limit, that's what you are,"" growled Whittington, with a sort of unwilling admiration. ""You took me in all right.

""Au revoir, my clever and charming young lady."" Tuppence sped lightly down the stairs. A wild elation possessed her. A neighbouring clock showed the time to be five minutes to twelve.

Madame de Bellegarde closed her eyes and gave a little cough, which, as a piece of dissimulation, struck Newman as really heroic. ""Dear mother,"" said the marquis, ""does this stuff amuse you so much?"" ""The rest is more amusing,"" said Newman. ""You had better not lose it."" Madame de Bellegarde opened her eyes; the scintillations had gone out of them; they were fixed and dead. But she smiled superbly with her narrow little lips, and repeated Newman\'s word. ""Amusing? Have I killed some one else?"" ""I don\'t count your daughter,"" said Newman, ""though I might! Your husband knew what you were doing. I have a proof of it whose existence you have never suspected."" And he turned to the marquis, who was terribly white--whiter than Newman had ever seen any one out of a picture. ""A paper written by the hand, and signed with the name, of Henri-Urbain de Bellegarde. Written after you, madame, had left him for dead, and while you, sir, had gone--not very fast--for the doctor."" The marquis looked at his mother; she turned away, looking vaguely round her. ""I must sit down,"" she said in a low tone, going toward the bench on which Newman had been sitting. ""Couldn\'t you have spoken to me alone?"" said the marquis to Newman, with a strange look. ""Well, yes, if I could have been sure of speaking to your mother alone, too,"" Newman answered. ""But I have had to take you as I could get you."" Madame de', 'man?"" he asked, eying him askance. ""Well, I hope so,"" said Newman. ""I rather suspect so. In that case, come again."" ""Ah, what an invitation!"" murmured Madame de Cintre, with something painful in her smile. ""Oh, I want Mr. Newman to come--particularly,"" said the young man. ""It will give me great pleasure. I shall be desolate if I miss one of his visits. But I maintain he must be brave. A stout heart, sir!"" And he offered Newman his hand. ""I shall not come to see you; I shall come to see Madame de Cintre,"" said Newman. ""You will need all the more courage."" ""Ah, Valentin!"" said Madame de Cintre, appealingly. ""Decidedly,"" cried Madame de Bellegarde, ""I am the only person here capable of saying something polite! Come to see me; you will need no courage,"" she said. Newman gave a laugh which was not altogether an assent, and took his leave. Madame de Cintre did not take up her sister\'s challenge to be gracious, but she looked with a certain troubled air at the retreating guest. CHAPTER VII One evening very late, about a week after his visit to Madame de Cintre, Newman\'s servant brought him a card. It was that of young M. de Bellegarde. When, a few moments later, he went to receive his visitor, he found him standing in the middle of his great gilded parlor and eying it from cornice to carpet. M. de Bellegarde\'s face, it seemed to Newman, expressed a sense of lively', 'like him,"" said Newman, genially. ""He amuses you, eh?"" ""Yes, perfectly."" ""Do you hear that, Valentin?"" said Madame de Bellegarde. ""You amuse Mr. Newman."" ""Perhaps we shall all come to that!"" Valentin exclaimed. ""You must see my other son,"" said Madame de Bellegarde. ""He is much better than this one. But he will not amuse you."" ""I don\'t know--I don\'t know!"" murmured Valentin, reflectively. ""But we shall very soon see. Here comes Monsieur mon frere."" The door had just opened to give ingress to a gentleman who stepped forward and whose face Newman remembered. He had been the author of our hero\'s discomfiture the first time he tried to present himself to Madame de Cintre. Valentin de Bellegarde went to meet his brother, looked at him a moment, and then, taking him by the arm, led him up to Newman. ""This is my excellent friend Mr. Newman,"" he said very blandly. ""You must know him."" ""I am delighted to know Mr. Newman,"" said the marquis with a low bow, but without offering his hand. ""He is the old woman at second-hand,"" Newman said to himself, as he returned M. de Bellegarde\'s greeting. And this was the starting-point of a speculative theory, in his mind, that the late marquis had been a very amiable foreigner, with an inclination to take life easily and a sense that it was difficult for the husband of the stilted little lady by the fire to do so.

They walked together a good minute without speaking, Soames with his mousing, mincing step, and old Jolyon upright and using his umbrella languidly as a walking-stick. They turned presently into comparative quiet, for old Jolyon\'s way to a second Board led him in the direction of Moorage Street. Then Soames, without lifting his eyes, began: ""I\'ve had this letter from Bosinney. You see what he says; I thought I\'d let you know. I\'ve spent a lot more than I intended on this house, and I want the position to be clear."" Old Jolyon ran his eyes unwillingly over the letter: ""What he says is clear enough,"" he said.

He did not mean to give her address without permission. Soames seemed to divine his thought. ""I don\'t want her address,"" he said; ""I know it."" ""What exactly do you want?"" ""She deserted me. I want a divorce."" ""Rather late in the day, isn\'t it?"" ""Yes,"" said Soames. And there was a silence.

""Do you wish me to see her about it?"" Soames raised his eyes to his cousin\'s face. ""I suppose there\'s someone,"" he said. A shrug moved Jolyon\'s shoulders. ""I don\'t know at all. I imagine you may have both lived as if the other were dead. It\'s usual in these cases."" Soames turned to the window.

Madame de Bellegarde closed her eyes and gave a little cough, which, as a piece of dissimulation, struck Newman as really heroic. ""Dear mother,"" said the marquis, ""does this stuff amuse you so much?"" ""The rest is more amusing,"" said Newman. ""You had better not lose it."" Madame de Bellegarde opened her eyes; the scintillations had gone out of them; they were fixed and dead. But she smiled superbly with her narrow little lips, and repeated Newman\'s word. ""Amusing? Have I killed some one else?"" ""I don\'t count your daughter,"" said Newman, ""though I might! Your husband knew what you were doing. I have a proof of it whose existence you have never suspected."" And he turned to the marquis, who was terribly white--whiter than Newman had ever seen any one out of a picture. ""A paper written by the hand, and signed with the name, of Henri-Urbain de Bellegarde. Written after you, madame, had left him for dead, and while you, sir, had gone--not very fast--for the doctor."" The marquis looked at his mother; she turned away, looking vaguely round her. ""I must sit down,"" she said in a low tone, going toward the bench on which Newman had been sitting. ""Couldn\'t you have spoken to me alone?"" said the marquis to Newman, with a strange look. ""Well, yes, if I could have been sure of speaking to your mother alone, too,"" Newman answered. ""But I have had to take you as I could get you."" Madame de', 'man?"" he asked, eying him askance. ""Well, I hope so,"" said Newman. ""I rather suspect so. In that case, come again."" ""Ah, what an invitation!"" murmured Madame de Cintre, with something painful in her smile. ""Oh, I want Mr. Newman to come--particularly,"" said the young man. ""It will give me great pleasure. I shall be desolate if I miss one of his visits. But I maintain he must be brave. A stout heart, sir!"" And he offered Newman his hand. ""I shall not come to see you; I shall come to see Madame de Cintre,"" said Newman. ""You will need all the more courage."" ""Ah, Valentin!"" said Madame de Cintre, appealingly. ""Decidedly,"" cried Madame de Bellegarde, ""I am the only person here capable of saying something polite! Come to see me; you will need no courage,"" she said. Newman gave a laugh which was not altogether an assent, and took his leave. Madame de Cintre did not take up her sister\'s challenge to be gracious, but she looked with a certain troubled air at the retreating guest. CHAPTER VII One evening very late, about a week after his visit to Madame de Cintre, Newman\'s servant brought him a card. It was that of young M. de Bellegarde. When, a few moments later, he went to receive his visitor, he found him standing in the middle of his great gilded parlor and eying it from cornice to carpet. M. de Bellegarde\'s face, it seemed to Newman, expressed a sense of lively', 'like him,"" said Newman, genially. ""He amuses you, eh?"" ""Yes, perfectly."" ""Do you hear that, Valentin?"" said Madame de Bellegarde. ""You amuse Mr. Newman."" ""Perhaps we shall all come to that!"" Valentin exclaimed. ""You must see my other son,"" said Madame de Bellegarde. ""He is much better than this one. But he will not amuse you."" ""I don\'t know--I don\'t know!"" murmured Valentin, reflectively. ""But we shall very soon see. Here comes Monsieur mon frere."" The door had just opened to give ingress to a gentleman who stepped forward and whose face Newman remembered. He had been the author of our hero\'s discomfiture the first time he tried to present himself to Madame de Cintre. Valentin de Bellegarde went to meet his brother, looked at him a moment, and then, taking him by the arm, led him up to Newman. ""This is my excellent friend Mr. Newman,"" he said very blandly. ""You must know him."" ""I am delighted to know Mr. Newman,"" said the marquis with a low bow, but without offering his hand. ""He is the old woman at second-hand,"" Newman said to himself, as he returned M. de Bellegarde\'s greeting. And this was the starting-point of a speculative theory, in his mind, that the late marquis had been a very amiable foreigner, with an inclination to take life easily and a sense that it was difficult for the husband of the stilted little lady by the fire to do so.

It was decided by Mr. Strong that Arnold Baxter should be removed to the camp on a stretcher, and four boys, including Sam and Tom, volunteered for the service.

Now, do you think that the people who will come here to see it will get pleasure enough from it to amount in all to a thousand dollars a day?"" ""I don\'t know,"" said Rollo, doubtfully. ""I\'d give one dollar, I know, to see it."" ""Yes,"" said Mr. George, ""so would I; and I do not know but that there would be three hundred thousand to come in a year, including all the great occasions that would bring out immense assemblages from all the surrounding country.""

Accordingly, as they passed by the man when they were leaving the church, Mr. George put a franc into his plate, and Rollo half a franc.

It was glorious news. ""Sure?"" asked Mrs. Dare, with tears in her eyes. ""Positive, madam,"" replied Mr. Styles. ""I will buy the claim for two thousand dollars if you need the money,"" he whispered. ""No, thank you; I can wait,"" she replied.

Upon Tommy's request for Mr. Carter, she showed them into a small study on the ground floor where she left them. Hardly a minute elapsed, however, before the door opened, and a tall man with a lean hawklike face and a tired manner entered the room. ""Mr. Y. A.?"" he said, and smiled. His smile was distinctly attractive. ""Do sit down, both of you."" They obeyed. He himself took a chair opposite to Tuppence and smiled at her encouragingly. There was something in the quality of his smile that made the girl's usual readiness desert her. As he did not seem inclined to open the conversation, Tuppence was forced to begin. ""We wanted to know--that is, would you be so kind as to tell us anything you know about Jane Finn?"" ""Jane Finn? Ah!"" Mr. Carter appeared to reflect. ""Well, the question is, what do you know about her?"" Tuppence drew herself up. ""I don't see that that's got anything to do with it."" ""No? But it has, you know, really it has."" He smiled again in his tired way, and continued reflectively. ""So that brings us down to it again. What do you know about Jane Finn? ""Come now,"" he continued, as Tuppence remained silent.

""Why did he look at you before he answered me?"" she asked, and laughed, for there was just light enough left to show the colour in Agatha\'s cheek. ""Well,"" she added, ""I told Allen he was sure to be the first."" Agatha looked at her in evident bewilderment, but she nodded. ""Yes,"" she said, ""of course, I knew it would come. Everybody knows by now that you have fallen out with Gregory."" ""But, as I told you, I haven\'t fallen out with him."" ""Then you certainly haven\'t married him, and if you have said \'No\' to Harry Wyllard because you would sooner take Gregory after all, you\'re a singularly unwise young woman. Anyway, you\'ll have to meet him when he comes to supper. Allen\'s fond of a talk with Harry; I can\'t have him kept away."" ""I was a little afraid of that,"" said Agatha quietly. ""What makes the situation more difficult is that he told me he would ask me again."" Mrs. Hastings appeared thoughtful. ""In that case he will in all probability do it; but I don\'t think you need feel diffident about meeting him, especially as you can\'t help it.

""Why did you do it?"" ""I thought you might save Gregory, if I told you."" ""That was all?"" Sally looked at her with incredulous eyes. ""No,"" answered Agatha simply, ""that was only part. It did not seem right that Gregory should go against Wyllard\'s wishes, and gamble the Range away on the wheat market."" She admitted it without hesitation, for she realized now exactly what had animated her to seek this painful interview. She was fighting Wyllard\'s battle, and that fact sustained her. Sally winced. ""Yes"" she agreed, ""I guess you had to tell me. He was fond of you. One could be proud of that. Harry Wyllard never did anything low down and mean."" Agatha did not resent her candor. Although this was a thing she would scarcely have credited a little while ago, she saw that the girl felt the contrast between Gregory\'s character and that of the man whose place he had taken, and regretted it. Agatha\'s eyes became dim with unshed tears. ""Wyllard, they think, is dead,"" she said, in a low voice. ""You have Gregory still."" Sally looked at her with unveiled compassion, and Agatha did not shrink from', 'be proud of that. Harry Wyllard never did anything low down and mean."" Agatha did not resent her candour. Although this was a thing she would scarcely have credited a little while ago, she saw that the girl felt the contrast between her lover\'s character and that of the man whose place he had taken, and regretted it.

Sally looked at her with unveiled compassion, and Agatha did not shrink from it. ""Yes,"" she said, with a simplicity that became her, ""and Gregory must have someone to--take care of him. I must do it if I can."" There was no doubt that Agatha was stirred. This half-taught girl\'s quiet acceptance of the burden that many women must carry once more made her almost ashamed. ""We will leave it to you,"" she said. Then it became evident that there was another side to Sally\'s character, for her manner changed, and the suggestive hardness crept back into her eyes.

But to her surprise, her companion did not back her up. His eyes were fixed on Mr. Carter, and his tone when he spoke held an unusual note of deference. ""I dare say the little we know won't be any good to you, sir. But such as it is, you're welcome to it."" ""Tommy!"" cried out Tuppence in surprise. Mr. Carter slewed round in his chair.

""It is nothing,"" Tommy insisted, a little fiercely. ""He says so,"" Grizel explained, ""not to alarm us. But he is suffering horribly.

""I think I could carry him,"" suggested Corp, with a forward movement that made Tommy stamp his foot--the wooden one. ""I am all right,"" he told them testily, and looking uneasily at Grizel. ""How brave of you to say so!"" said she. ""It is just like him,"" Elspeth said, pleased with Grizel\'s remark. ""I am sure it is,"" Grizel said, so graciously. It was very naughty of her. Had she given him a chance he would have explained that it was all a mistake of Grizel\'s. That had been his intention; but now a devil entered into Tommy and spoke for him. ""I must have slipped and sprained my ankle,"" he said. ""It is slightly painful; but I shall be able to walk home all right, Corp, if you let me use you as a staff."" I think he was a little surprised to hear himself saying this; but, as soon as it was said, he liked it. He was Captain Stroke playing in the Den again, after all, and playing as well as ever. Nothing being so real to Tommy as pretence, I daresay he even began to feel his ankle hurting', 'have endured more stoically though there had been nothing the matter with it."" ""It was soon over,"" Tommy replied lightly. ""I think Elspeth suffered more than I."" Elspeth told the story of his heroism. ""I could not stay in the room,"" she said; ""it was too terrible."" And Grizel despised too tender-hearted Elspeth for that; she was so courageous at facing pain herself. But Tommy had guessed that Elspeth was trembling behind the door, and he had called out, ""Don\'t cry, Elspeth; I am all right; it is nothing at all."" ""How noble!"" was Grizel\'s comment, when she heard of this; and then Elspeth was her friend again, insisted on her staying to tea, and went into the kitchen to prepare it. Aaron was out. The two were alone now, and in the circumstances some men would have given the lady the opportunity to apologize, if such was her desire. But Tommy\'s was a more generous nature; his manner was that of one less sorry to be misjudged than anxious that Grizel should not suffer too much from remorse. If she had asked his pardon then and there, I am sure he would have replied, ""Right willingly, Grizel,"" and begged her not to give another thought to the matter. What is of more importance, Grizel was sure of this also, and it was the magnanimity of him that especially annoyed her. There seemed to be no disturbing it. Even when she said, ""Which foot is it?"" he answered, ""The one', 'shake Corp by the hand again."" ""And Aaron,"" said Elspeth. She was knitting stockings for Aaron at that moment. ""And Gavinia,"" Tommy said, ""and the Dominie."" ""And Ailie."" And then came an awkward pause, for they were both thinking of that independent girl called Grizel. She was seldom discussed. Tommy was oddly shy about mentioning her name; he would have preferred Elspeth to mention it: and Elspeth had misgivings that this was so, with the result that neither could say ""Grizel"" without wondering what was in the other\'s mind. Tommy had written twice to Grizel, the first time unknown to Elspeth, but that was in the days when the ladies of the penny numbers were disturbing him, and, against his better judgment (for well he knew she would never stand it), he had begun his letter with these mad words: ""Dear Little Woman."" She did not answer this, but soon afterwards she wrote to Elspeth, and he was not mentioned in the letter proper, but it carried a sting in its tail. ""P.S.,"" it said ""How is Sentimental Tommy?"" None but a fiend in human shape could have written thus, and Elspeth put her protecting arms round her brother. ""Now we know what Grizel is,"" she said. ""I am done with her now.""

There was also a very romantic story afloat as to an engagement which had existed between Lady Laura and Phineas Finn before the lady had been induced by her father to marry the richer suitor. Various details were given in corroboration of these stories. Was it not known that the Earl had purchased the submission of Phineas Finn by a seat for his borough of Loughton? Was it not known that Lord Chiltern, the brother of Lady Laura, had fought a duel with Phineas Finn? Was it not known that Mr. Kennedy himself had been as it were coerced into quiescence by the singular fact that he had been saved from garotters in the street by the opportune interference of Phineas Finn?

Eventually his body was washed ashore, and identified beyond any possible doubt. But the oilskin packet was missing!

After the torpedo struck the ship, in the few moments during the launching of the boats, Danvers was seen speaking to a young American girl. No one actually saw him pass anything to her, but he might have done so. It seems to me quite likely that he entrusted the papers to this girl, believing that she, as a woman, had a greater chance of bringing them safely to shore.

At length the judge took his seat, and the clerk of the crown sat beneath him ready to record the decision of the jury. A few lighted candles were stuck about in different parts of the court; but they were lost in the obscurity of the large, dark, dismal building. The foreman stood ready with a written and signed paper. The judge asked him if they had all come to a unanimous verdict, and he answered in the affirmative; and handed the paper to the clerk of the peace, who glancing his eye upon it, and half turning round to the judge said in his peculiar, sonorous voice-- ""My lord, the prisoner has been found guilty."" ""Gentlemen, is that your verdict?"" said the judge; and they said it was. The prisoner stood up at the bar erect without moving. He neither shook nor trembled now. If it were not that his lips were pressed quite close together, he would have appeared to have heard the verdict without emotion. Not so Father John; he had been leaning back, anxiously waiting till the one fatal word met his ear; and then his head fell forward on the desk, and he sobbed like a woman.

If an officer meet with resistance in the execution of a process, he has an undoubted right to call any citizen to his assistance; and the acts of such assistant come within the protection of the law. I shall leave you to judge, gentlemen, from the testimony, how far the witness in this prosecution can be so considered, feeling less reluctance to submit the case thus informally to your decision, because there is yet another indictment to be tried, which involves heavier charges against the unfortunate prisoner.” The tone of Marmaduke was mild and insinuating, and, as his sentiments were given with such apparent impartiality, they did not fail of carrying due weight with the jury. The grave-looking yeomen who composed this tribunal laid their heads together for a few minutes, without leaving the box, when the foreman arose,', 'they had to decide whether he had, in accordance with the theory of the prosecution, carried that threat into effect; or whether on the other hand, as the defense suggested, the deceased had fallen a victim to the agent of the association which had threatened his life. He was bound to tell them that if they entertained any doubt as to the guilt of the prisoner at the bar they were bound to give him the benefit of the doubt. The jury consulted together for a short time and then expressed their desire to retire to consider their verdict. They were absent about half an hour and on their return the foreman said in reply to the question of the judge that they found the prisoner ""Not Guilty."" A perfect silence reigned in the court when the jury entered the box, and something like a sigh of relief followed their verdict. It was expected, and indeed there was some surprise when the jury retired, for the general opinion was that whether guilty or innocent the prosecution had failed to bring home unmistakably the crime to the prisoner. That he might have committed it was certain, that he had committed it was probable, but it was assuredly not proved that he and none other had been the perpetrator of the crime.

Accordingly, as they passed by the man when they were leaving the church, Mr. George put a franc into his plate, and Rollo half a franc.

Jethro made no remark concerning this presumption on the part of the congressman of the district. Cynthia\'s indignation against Mr. Sutton was very real, and it was some time before she could compose herself sufficiently to tell Jethro what had happened. His enjoyment as he listened may be imagined but presently he forgot this, and became aware that something really troubled her. ""Uncle Jethro,"" she asked suddenly, ""why do they treat me as they do?"" He did not answer at once. This was because of a pain around his heart--had she known it. He had felt that pain before.

Blanche\'s self-possession, resolutely as she struggled to preserve it, was not strong enough to keep her eyes from turning toward Geoffrey with an expression which betrayed the reluctant interest that she now felt in him. He stopped, noticing something entirely new in the look with which the young lady was regarding him. ""Beg your pardon,"" said Geoffrey. ""Do you wish to speak to me?"" Blanche\'s face flushed all over. Her uncle came to the rescue. ""Miss Lundie and I hope you have slept well Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick, jocosely. ""That\'s all."" ""Oh? That\'s all?"" said Geoffrey still', 'looked like himself again. ""Why go indoors this lovely weather?"" he said. ""Suppose we take a turn in the garden?"" Blanche pressed Anne\'s hand significantly. The proposal was evidently made for a purpose. They turned the corner of the cottage and gained the large garden at the back--the two ladies walking together, arm in arm; Sir Patrick and Geoffrey following them. Little by little, Blanche quickened her pace. ""I have got my instructions,"" she whispered to Anne. ""Let\'s get out of his hearing."" It was more easily said than done. Geoffrey kept close behind them. ""Consider my lameness, Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick. ""Not quite so fast."" It was well intended. But Geoffrey\'s cunning had taken the alarm. Instead of dropping behind with Sir Patrick, he called to his wife. ""Consider Sir Patrick\'s lameness,"" he repeated. ""Not quite so fast."" Sir Patrick met that check with characteristic readiness. When Anne slackened her pace, he addressed himself to Geoffrey, stopping deliberately in the middle of the path. ""Let me give you my message from Holchester House,"" he said. The two ladies were still slowly walking on. Geoffrey was placed between the alternatives of staying with Sir Patrick and leaving them by themselves--or of following them and leaving Sir Patrick. Deliberately, on his side, he followed the ladies. Sir Patrick called him back. ""I told you I wished to speak to you,"" he said, sharply. Driven to bay, Geoffrey openly revealed his resolution to give Blanche no opportunity of speaking in private', 'look at Anne. The look was not returned--was not even seen. From the moment when she had taken her place by Sir Patrick, Anne\'s eyes had rested on Blanche. They never moved--they never for an instant lost their tender sadness--when the woman who hated her spoke. All that was beautiful and true in that noble nature seemed to find its one sufficient encouragement in Blanche. As she looked once more at the sister of the unforgotten days of old, its native beauty of expression shone out again in her worn and weary face. Every man in the room (but Geoffrey) looked at her; and every man (but Geoffrey) felt for her. Sir Patrick addressed a second question to his sister-in-law. ""Is there any one here to represent the interests of Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn?"" he asked. Lady Lundie referred Sir Patrick to Geoffrey himself. Without looking up, Geoffrey motioned with his big brown hand to Mr. Moy, sitting by his side. Mr. Moy (holding the legal rank in Scotland which corresponds to the rank held by solicitors in England) rose and bowed to Sir Patrick, with the courtesy due to a man eminent in his time at the Scottish Bar. ""I represent Mr. Delamayn,"" he said. ""I congratulate myself, Sir Patrick, on having your ability and experience to appeal to in the conduct of the pending inquiry."" Sir Patrick returned the compliment as well as the bow. ""It is I who should learn from you,"" he answered.

The photograph of Jane Finn, which would have been of the utmost value to the police in tracing her, was lost beyond recovery. Once again ""Mr. Brown"" had triumphed. The immediate result of this set back was to effect a rapprochement between Julius Hersheimmer and the Young Adventurers. All barriers went down with a crash, and Tommy and Tuppence felt they had known the young American all their lives. They abandoned the discreet reticence of ""private inquiry agents,"" and revealed to him the whole history of the joint venture, whereat the young man declared himself ""tickled to death."" He turned to Tuppence at the close of the narration. ""I've always had a kind of idea that English girls were just a mite moss-grown. Old-fashioned and sweet, you know, but scared to move round without a footman or a maiden aunt. I guess I'm a bit behind the times!"" The upshot of these confidential relations was that Tommy and Tuppence took up their abode forthwith at the Ritz, in order, as Tuppence put it, to keep in touch with Jane Finn's only living relation.

""Were you there?"" ""Yes,"" said Austen. ""I\'ll send you a copy. I\'d like to talk it over with you. Come on, Victoria, I\'ve arranged for an early lunch. Come on, Mrs. Pomfret--get in, Alice."" Mrs. Pomfret, still protesting against the profane interruption to Mr. Crewe\'s speech, bent her head to enter Mr. Crewe\'s booby sleigh, which had his crest on the panel. Alice was hustled in next, but Victoria avoided his ready assistance and got in herself, Mr. Crewe getting in beside her. ""Au revoir,"" she called out to Austen, as the door slammed. The coachman gathered his horses together, and off they went at a brisk trot. Then the little group which had been watching the performance dispersed. Halfway across the park Austen perceived some one signaling violently to him, and discovered his friend, young Tom Gaylord. ""Come to dinner with me,"" said young Tom, ""and tell me whether the speech of your friend from Leith will send him to Congress. I saw you hobnobbing with him just now. What\'s the matter, Austen? I haven\'t seen that guilty expression on your face since we were at college together."" ""What\'s the best livery-stable in town?"" Austen asked. ""By George, I wondered why you came down here. Who are you going to take', 'hadn\'t long been back from that Western experience. Well, your father has one decided consolation; you have fulfilled his hope that you would settle down here and practise in the State. And I hear that you are fast forging to the front.

""And on the occasion when you did me the honour to call on me,"" said Mr. Flint, ""if I remember rightly, you expressed some rather radical views--for the son of Hilary Vane."" ""For the son of Hilary Vane,"" Austen agreed, with a smile. Mr. Flint ignored the implication in the repetition. ""Thinking as mach as I do of Mr. Vane, I confess that your views at that time rather disturbed me. It is a matter of relief to learn that you have refused to lend yourself to the schemes of men like our neighbour, Mr. Humphrey Crewe, of Leith."" ""Honesty compels me to admit,"" answered Austen, ""that I did not refrain on Mr. Crewe\'s account."" ""Although,"" said Mr. Flint, drumming on the table, ""there was some talk that you were to be brought forward as a dark horse in the convention, and as a candidate unfriendly to the interests of the Northeastern Railroads, I am glad you did not consent to be put in any such position.

He did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of the day. He should like to see the old house again exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his, and Emma\'s, and Harriet\'s going there some very fine morning. He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--very kind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of dining out."" Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body\'s most ready concurrence. The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose', 'expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.

Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was almost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston might be his son\'s superior.--In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming, and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.--She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley\'s not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with', 'was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet.

Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.

Five minutes later the young couple emerged into Piccadilly, and a few seconds later a taxi was bearing them to The Laurels, Glendower Road, N.7, the residence of Mrs. Edgar Keith, whose name figured first in a list of seven reposing in Tommy's pocket-book.

'I can't speak to you just now, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'I am engaged at this moment, Sam.' 'Beg your pardon, Sir,' rejoined Mr. Weller. 'But here's a lady here, Sir, as says she's somethin' wery partickler to disclose.' 'I can't see any lady,' replied Mr. Pickwick, whose mind was filled with visions of Mrs. Bardell.

'The wall is very low, sir, and your servant will give you a leg up.' 'My servant will give me a leg up,' repeated Mr. Pickwick mechanically.

Down they sat to breakfast, but it was evident, notwithstanding the boasting of Mr. Peter Magnus, that he laboured under a very considerable degree of nervousness, of which loss of appetite, a propensity to upset the tea-things, a spectral attempt at drollery, and an irresistible inclination to look at the clock, every other second, were among the principal symptoms.

""It is nothing,"" Tommy insisted, a little fiercely. ""He says so,"" Grizel explained, ""not to alarm us. But he is suffering horribly. Just before I called to you his face was all drawn up in pain."" This made the sufferer wince. ""That was another twinge,"" she said promptly. ""What is to be done, Elspeth?"" ""I think I could carry him,"" suggested Corp, with a forward movement that made Tommy stamp his foot--the wooden one. ""I am all right,"" he told them testily, and looking uneasily at Grizel. ""How brave of you to say so!"" said she. ""It is just like him,"" Elspeth said, pleased with Grizel\'s remark. ""I am sure it is,"" Grizel said, so graciously. It was very naughty of her. Had she given him a chance he would have explained that it was all a mistake of Grizel\'s. That had been his intention; but now a devil entered into Tommy and spoke for him. ""I must have slipped and sprained my ankle,"" he said. ""It is slightly painful; but I shall be able to walk home all right, Corp, if you let me use you as a staff."" I think he was a little surprised to hear himself saying this; but, as soon as it was said, he liked it. He was Captain Stroke playing in the Den again, after all, and playing as well as ever. Nothing being so real to Tommy as pretence, I daresay he even began to feel his ankle hurting', 'have endured more stoically though there had been nothing the matter with it."" ""It was soon over,"" Tommy replied lightly. ""I think Elspeth suffered more than I."" Elspeth told the story of his heroism. ""I could not stay in the room,"" she said; ""it was too terrible."" And Grizel despised too tender-hearted Elspeth for that; she was so courageous at facing pain herself. But Tommy had guessed that Elspeth was trembling behind the door, and he had called out, ""Don\'t cry, Elspeth; I am all right; it is nothing at all."" ""How noble!"" was Grizel\'s comment, when she heard of this; and then Elspeth was her friend again, insisted on her staying to tea, and went into the kitchen to prepare it. Aaron was out. The two were alone now, and in the circumstances some men would have given the lady the opportunity to apologize, if such was her desire. But Tommy\'s was a more generous nature; his manner was that of one less sorry to be misjudged than anxious that Grizel should not suffer too much from remorse. If she had asked his pardon then and there, I am sure he would have replied, ""Right willingly, Grizel,"" and begged her not to give another thought to the matter. What is of more importance, Grizel was sure of this also, and it was the magnanimity of him that especially annoyed her. There seemed to be no disturbing it. Even when she said, ""Which foot is it?"" he answered, ""The one', 'shake Corp by the hand again."" ""And Aaron,"" said Elspeth. She was knitting stockings for Aaron at that moment. ""And Gavinia,"" Tommy said, ""and the Dominie."" ""And Ailie."" And then came an awkward pause, for they were both thinking of that independent girl called Grizel. She was seldom discussed. Tommy was oddly shy about mentioning her name; he would have preferred Elspeth to mention it: and Elspeth had misgivings that this was so, with the result that neither could say ""Grizel"" without wondering what was in the other\'s mind. Tommy had written twice to Grizel, the first time unknown to Elspeth, but that was in the days when the ladies of the penny numbers were disturbing him, and, against his better judgment (for well he knew she would never stand it), he had begun his letter with these mad words: ""Dear Little Woman."" She did not answer this, but soon afterwards she wrote to Elspeth, and he was not mentioned in the letter proper, but it carried a sting in its tail. ""P.S.,"" it said ""How is Sentimental Tommy?"" None but a fiend in human shape could have written thus, and Elspeth put her protecting arms round her brother. ""Now we know what Grizel is,"" she said. ""I am done with her now.""

Though familiar with the technicalities from a course of novel reading, he had never before attempted to ""follow"" anyone, and it appeared to him at once that, in actual practice, the proceeding was fraught with difficulties. Supposing, for instance, that they should suddenly hail a taxi? In books, you simply leapt into another, promised the driver a sovereign--or its modern equivalent--and there you were. In actual fact, Tommy foresaw that it was extremely likely there would be no second taxi. Therefore he would have to run. What happened in actual fact to a young man who ran incessantly and persistently through the London streets? In a main road he might hope to create the illusion that he was merely running for a bus. But in these obscure aristocratic byways he could not but feel that an officious policeman might stop him to explain matters. At this juncture in his thoughts a taxi with flag erect turned the corner of the street ahead. Tommy held his breath. Would they hail it? He drew a sigh of relief as they allowed it to pass unchallenged. Their course was a zigzag one designed to bring them as quickly as possible to Oxford Street. When at length they turned into it, proceeding in an easterly direction, Tommy slightly increased his pace. Little by little he gained upon them.

At length the judge took his seat, and the clerk of the crown sat beneath him ready to record the decision of the jury. A few lighted candles were stuck about in different parts of the court; but they were lost in the obscurity of the large, dark, dismal building. The foreman stood ready with a written and signed paper. The judge asked him if they had all come to a unanimous verdict, and he answered in the affirmative; and handed the paper to the clerk of the peace, who glancing his eye upon it, and half turning round to the judge said in his peculiar, sonorous voice-- ""My lord, the prisoner has been found guilty."" ""Gentlemen, is that your verdict?"" said the judge; and they said it was. The prisoner stood up at the bar erect without moving. He neither shook nor trembled now. If it were not that his lips were pressed quite close together, he would have appeared to have heard the verdict without emotion. Not so Father John; he had been leaning back, anxiously waiting till the one fatal word met his ear; and then his head fell forward on the desk, and he sobbed like a woman.

If an officer meet with resistance in the execution of a process, he has an undoubted right to call any citizen to his assistance; and the acts of such assistant come within the protection of the law. I shall leave you to judge, gentlemen, from the testimony, how far the witness in this prosecution can be so considered, feeling less reluctance to submit the case thus informally to your decision, because there is yet another indictment to be tried, which involves heavier charges against the unfortunate prisoner.” The tone of Marmaduke was mild and insinuating, and, as his sentiments were given with such apparent impartiality, they did not fail of carrying due weight with the jury. The grave-looking yeomen who composed this tribunal laid their heads together for a few minutes, without leaving the box, when the foreman arose,', 'they had to decide whether he had, in accordance with the theory of the prosecution, carried that threat into effect; or whether on the other hand, as the defense suggested, the deceased had fallen a victim to the agent of the association which had threatened his life. He was bound to tell them that if they entertained any doubt as to the guilt of the prisoner at the bar they were bound to give him the benefit of the doubt. The jury consulted together for a short time and then expressed their desire to retire to consider their verdict. They were absent about half an hour and on their return the foreman said in reply to the question of the judge that they found the prisoner ""Not Guilty."" A perfect silence reigned in the court when the jury entered the box, and something like a sigh of relief followed their verdict. It was expected, and indeed there was some surprise when the jury retired, for the general opinion was that whether guilty or innocent the prosecution had failed to bring home unmistakably the crime to the prisoner. That he might have committed it was certain, that he had committed it was probable, but it was assuredly not proved that he and none other had been the perpetrator of the crime.

Tommy took a seat at the table next to them, sitting directly behind Whittington in case of recognition. On the other hand, he had a full view of the second man and studied him attentively. He was fair, with a weak, unpleasant face, and Tommy put him down as being either a Russian or a Pole. He was probably about fifty years of age, his shoulders cringed a little as he talked, and his eyes, small and crafty, shifted unceasingly. Having already lunched heartily, Tommy contented himself with ordering a Welsh rarebit and a cup of coffee. Whittington ordered a substantial lunch for himself and his companion; then, as the waitress withdrew, he moved his chair a little closer to the table and began to talk earnestly in a low voice. The other man joined in.

Tommy caught the word ""Ireland"" several times, also ""propaganda,"" but of Jane Finn there was no mention. Suddenly, in a lull in the clatter of the room, he got one phrase entire. Whittington was speaking. ""Ah, but you don't know Flossie. She's a marvel. An archbishop would swear she was his own mother. She gets the voice right every time, and that's really the principal thing."" Tommy did not hear Boris's reply, but in response to it Whittington said something that sounded like: ""Of course--only in an emergency...."" Then he lost the thread again. But presently the phrases became distinct again whether because the other two had insensibly raised their voices, or because Tommy's ears were getting more attuned, he could not tell. But two words certainly had a most stimulating effect upon the listener. They were uttered by Boris and they were: ""Mr. Brown."" Whittington seemed to remonstrate with him, but he merely laughed. ""Why not, my friend? It is a name most respectable--most common. Did he not choose it for that reason? Ah, I should like to meet him--Mr. Brown."" There was a steely ring in Whittington's voice as he replied: ""Who knows? You may have met him already."" ""Bah!"" retorted the other. ""That is children's talk--a fable for the police.

Therefore he was left with a choice as to which he would follow. Obviously, he could not follow both of them unless----Like Boris, he glanced up at the clock, and then to the announcement board of the trains. The Bournemouth train left at 3.30. It was now ten past. Whittington and Boris were walking up and down by the bookstall. He gave one doubtful look at them, then hurried into an adjacent telephone box. He dared not waste time in trying to get hold of Tuppence. In all probability she was still in the neighbourhood of South Audley Mansions. But there remained another ally. He rang up the Ritz and asked for Julius Hersheimmer. There was a click and a buzz. Oh, if only the young American was in his room! There was another click, and then ""Hello"" in unmistakable accents came over the wire. ""That you, Hersheimmer? Beresford speaking. I'm at Waterloo. I've followed Whittington and another man here. No time to explain. Whittington's off to Bournemouth by the 3.30. Can you get there by then?"" The reply was reassuring. ""Sure. I'll hustle."" The telephone rang off. Tommy put back the receiver with a sigh of relief. His opinion of Julius's power of hustling was high. He felt instinctively that the American would arrive in time.

""Were you there?"" ""Yes,"" said Austen. ""I\'ll send you a copy. I\'d like to talk it over with you. Come on, Victoria, I\'ve arranged for an early lunch. Come on, Mrs. Pomfret--get in, Alice."" Mrs. Pomfret, still protesting against the profane interruption to Mr. Crewe\'s speech, bent her head to enter Mr. Crewe\'s booby sleigh, which had his crest on the panel. Alice was hustled in next, but Victoria avoided his ready assistance and got in herself, Mr. Crewe getting in beside her. ""Au revoir,"" she called out to Austen, as the door slammed. The coachman gathered his horses together, and off they went at a brisk trot. Then the little group which had been watching the performance dispersed. Halfway across the park Austen perceived some one signaling violently to him, and discovered his friend, young Tom Gaylord. ""Come to dinner with me,"" said young Tom, ""and tell me whether the speech of your friend from Leith will send him to Congress. I saw you hobnobbing with him just now. What\'s the matter, Austen? I haven\'t seen that guilty expression on your face since we were at college together."" ""What\'s the best livery-stable in town?"" Austen asked. ""By George, I wondered why you came down here.

""And on the occasion when you did me the honour to call on me,"" said Mr. Flint, ""if I remember rightly, you expressed some rather radical views--for the son of Hilary Vane."" ""For the son of Hilary Vane,"" Austen agreed, with a smile. Mr. Flint ignored the implication in the repetition. ""Thinking as mach as I do of Mr. Vane, I confess that your views at that time rather disturbed me. It is a matter of relief to learn that you have refused to lend yourself to the schemes of men like our neighbour, Mr. Humphrey Crewe, of Leith."" ""Honesty compels me to admit,"" answered Austen, ""that I did not refrain on Mr. Crewe\'s account."" ""Although,"" said Mr. Flint, drumming on the table, ""there was some talk that you were to be brought forward as a dark horse in the convention, and as a candidate unfriendly to the interests of the Northeastern Railroads, I am glad you did not consent to be put in any such position.

In spite of the carte blanche assured to him, he had not yet acquired the habit of going about with any considerable sum of money on him. The taking of the first-class ticket to Bournemouth had left him with only a few shillings in his pocket. It was to be hoped that Julius would arrive better provided. In the meantime, the minutes were creeping by: 3.15, 3.20, 3.25, 3.27. Supposing Julius did not get there in time. 3.29.... Doors were banging. Tommy felt cold waves of despair pass over him.

From Waterloo Boris took the tube as far as Piccadilly Circus. Then he walked up Shaftesbury Avenue, finally turning off into the maze of mean streets round Soho. Tommy followed him at a judicious distance. They reached at length a small dilapidated square. The houses there had a sinister air in the midst of their dirt and decay. Boris looked round, and Tommy drew back into the shelter of a friendly porch. The place was almost deserted. It was a cul-de-sac, and consequently no traffic passed that way. The stealthy way the other had looked round stimulated Tommy's imagination. From the shelter of the doorway he watched him go up the steps of a particularly evil-looking house and rap sharply, with a peculiar rhythm, on the door. It was opened promptly, he said a word or two to the doorkeeper, then passed inside. The door was shut to again. It was at this juncture that Tommy lost his head. What he ought to have done, what any sane man would have done, was to remain patiently where he was and wait for his man to come out again. What he did do was entirely foreign to the sober common sense which was, as a rule, his leading characteristic. Something, as he expressed it, seemed to snap in his brain. Without a moment's pause for reflection he, too, went",28,Hauntings in a dark room,28_darkness_haunted_door_light,"['darkness', 'haunted', 'door', 'light', 'candle', 'ghost', 'room', 'shadow', 'dark', 'silence']","['a flash of light it passed into his mind that the empty room was not two paces from him.

He stepped through the door, knocking Beatrice\'s feet against the framework as he did so, closed it--to shut it he had no time--and stood gasping behind it. The gleam of light drew nearer. Merciful powers! he had been seen--the old man was coming in. What could he say? Tell the truth, that was all; but who would believe such a story? why, it was one that he should scarcely care to advance in a court of law. Could he expect a father to believe it--a father finding a man crouched like a thief behind a door at the dead of night with his lovely daughter senseless in his arms? He had already thought of going straight to Mr. Granger, but had abandoned the idea as hopeless. Who would believe this tale of sleep-walking? For the first time in his life Geoffrey felt terribly afraid, both for Beatrice and himself; the hair rose on his head, his heart stood still, and a cold perspiration started on to his face.

This done, he advanced on tiptoe to the open staircase door, passed through it, and secured it on the inner side as usual. Mr. Bashwood had seen him at the apparatus; Mr. Bashwood had noticed the manner of his withdrawal through the staircase door. Again the sense of an unutterable expectation throbbed at his heart. A terror that was slow and cold and deadly crept into his hands, and guided them in the dark to the key that had been left for him in the inner side of the door. He turned it in vague distrust of what might happen next, and waited. The slow minutes passed, and nothing happened. The silence was horrible; the solitude of the lonely corridor was a solitude of invisible treacheries. He began to count to keep his mind employed--to keep his own growing dread away from him. The numbers, as he whispered them, followed each other slowly up to a hundred, and still nothing happened. He had begun the second hundred; he had got on to twenty--when, without a sound to betray that he had been moving in his room, Midwinter suddenly appeared in the corridor.

He closed the window, and, taking off his coat, barricaded the door with all the heaviest furniture in the room.

He turned the lamp down a little, and reloading the empty chambers of his revolver, placed it by the side of the lamp on the drawers. Then, as he turned back the clothes, he fancied that something moved beneath them. As he paused, it dropped lightly from the other side of the bed to the floor. At first he sat, with knitted brows, trying to see what it was. He had only had a glimpse of it, but he certainly had an idea that it was alive. A rat perhaps.

A villainous-faced man with close-cropped hair stood in the doorway. ""Well?"" he grunted. It was at that moment that the full realization of his folly began to come home to Tommy. But he dared not hesitate. He seized at the first words that came into his mind. ""Mr. Brown?"" he said. To his surprise the man stood aside.

If audacity had successfully carried him so far, it was to be hoped it would carry him yet farther. He quietly passed into the house and mounted the ramshackle staircase. Everything in the house was filthy beyond words. The grimy paper, of a pattern now indistinguishable, hung in loose festoons from the wall. In every angle was a grey mass of cobweb. Tommy proceeded leisurely. By the time he reached the bend of the staircase, he had heard the man below disappear into a back room. Clearly no suspicion attached to him as yet. To come to the house and ask for ""Mr. Brown"" appeared indeed to be a reasonable and natural proceeding. At the top of the stairs Tommy halted to consider his next move.

But what held his glance fascinated was a small recess immediately on his right, half concealed by a torn velvet curtain. It was directly opposite the left-handed door and, owing to its angle, it also commanded a good view of the upper part of the staircase. As a hiding-place for one or, at a pinch, two men, it was ideal, being about two feet deep and three feet wide. It attracted Tommy mightily. He thought things over in his usual slow and steady way, deciding that the mention of ""Mr. Brown"" was not a request for an individual, but in all probability a password used by the gang. His lucky use of it had gained him admission. So far he had aroused no suspicion. But he must decide quickly on his next step. Suppose he were boldly to enter the room on the left of the passage. Would the mere fact of his having been admitted to the house be sufficient? Perhaps a further password would be required, or, at any rate, some proof of identity.

He could not hope to sustain his part indefinitely; sooner or later he was almost bound to betray himself, and then he would have thrown away a vital chance in mere foolhardiness. A repetition of the signal knock sounded on the door below, and Tommy, his mind made up, slipped quickly into the recess, and cautiously drew the curtain farther across so that it shielded him completely from sight. There were several rents and slits in the ancient material which afforded him a good view. He would watch events, and any time he chose could, after all, join the assembly, modelling his behaviour on that of the new arrival. The man who came up the staircase with a furtive, soft-footed tread was quite unknown to Tommy. He was obviously of the very dregs of society. The low beetling brows, and the criminal jaw, the bestiality of the whole countenance were new to the young man, though he was a type that Scotland Yard would have recognized at a glance. The man passed the recess, breathing heavily as he went. He stopped at the door opposite, and gave a repetition of the signal knock.

As the new-comer entered he glanced up, and with a correct, but curiously precise enunciation, which attracted Tommy's notice, he asked: ""Your number, comrade?"" ""Fourteen, gov'nor,"" replied the other hoarsely. ""Correct."" The door shut again. ""If that isn't a Hun, I'm a Dutchman!"" said Tommy to himself. ""And running the show darned systematically too--as they always do. Lucky I didn't roll in. I'd have given the wrong number, and there would have been the deuce to pay. No, this is the place for me. Hullo, here's another knock."" This visitor proved to be of an entirely different type to the last. Tommy recognized in him an Irish Sinn Feiner. Certainly Mr. Brown's organization was a far-reaching concern. The common criminal, the well-bred Irish gentleman, the pale Russian, and the efficient German master of the ceremonies! Truly a strange and sinister gathering! Who was this man who held in his finger these curiously variegated links of an unknown chain? In this case, the procedure was exactly the same. The signal knock, the demand for a number, and the reply ""Correct."" Two knocks followed in quick succession on the door below.

When the conductor came along, Psmith gave him half a crown, and asked after his wife and the little ones at home. The conductor thanked goodness that he was a bachelor, punched the tickets, and retired. 'Subject for a historical picture,' said Psmith.

I, Psmith, have paid a penny for a ticket on a tram. If this should get about the clubs! I tell you, Comrade Jackson, no such crisis has ever occurred before in the course of my career.' 'You can always get off, you know,' said Mike. 'He thinks of everything,' said Psmith, admiringly. 'You have touched the spot with an unerring finger. Let us descend. I observe in the distance a cab.

""What will you do,"" asked my father, alarmed for my safety, ""among these wild undergraduates? I fear for my Rupert."" ""Have no fear, father,"" I replied. ""Comrade Jackson will be beside me."" His face brightened immediately. ""Comrade Jackson,"" he said, ""is a man in whom I have the supremest confidence. If he is with you I shall sleep easy of nights."" It was after that that the conversation drifted to the subject of agents.\' Psmith called for the bill and paid it in the affable manner of a monarch signing a charter. Mike sat silent, his mind in a whirl. He saw exactly what had happened. He could almost hear Psmith talking his father into agreeing with his scheme. He could think of nothing to say. As usually happened in any emotional crisis in his life, words absolutely deserted him. The thing was too big. Anything he could say would sound too feeble. When a friend has solved all your difficulties and smoothed out all the rough places which were looming in your path, you cannot thank him as if he had asked you to lunch. The occasion demanded some neat, polished speech; and neat, polished speeches were beyond Mike. \'I say, Psmith--\' he began. Psmith rose. \'Let', 'you so,"" said Mike to Psmith. ""Don\'t go,"" suggested Psmith. ""Tell him to write."" Mike got up. ""All this is very trying,"" said Psmith. ""I\'m seeing nothing of you today."" He turned to the small boy. ""Tell Willie,"" he added, ""that Mr. Jackson will be with him in a moment."" The emissary departed. ""_You\'re_ all right,"" said Psmith encouragingly. ""Just you keep on saying you\'re all right.

Three minutes later came another, a man of commanding appearance, exquisitely dressed, and evidently well born. His face, again, was not unknown to the watcher, though he could not for the moment put a name to it. After his arrival there was a long wait. In fact Tommy concluded that the gathering was now complete, and was just cautiously creeping out from his hiding-place, when another knock sent him scuttling back to cover. This last-comer came up the stairs so quietly that he was almost abreast of Tommy before the young man had realized his presence. He was a small man, very pale, with a gentle almost womanish air. The angle of the cheek-bones hinted at his Slavonic ancestry, otherwise there was nothing to indicate his nationality. As he passed the recess, he turned his head slowly. The strange light eyes seemed to burn through the curtain; Tommy could hardly believe that the man did not know he was there and in spite of himself he shivered. He was no more fanciful than the majority of young Englishmen, but he could not rid himself of the impression that some unusually potent force emanated from the man.

The change in the German's voice was audible as he replied with slight hesitation: ""We have received a message. It is impossible for him to be present in person."" He stopped, giving a curious impression of having left the sentence unfinished. A very slow smile overspread the face of the other. He looked round at a circle of uneasy faces. ""Ah! I understand. I have read of his methods. He works in the dark and trusts no one. But, all the same, it is possible that he is among us now....""

The statement which they made began by acknowledging that they had not of themselves any original right to try such a question, the Czar himself, according to the ancient constitution of the empire, having sole and exclusive jurisdiction in all such affairs, without being beholden to his subjects in regard to them in any manner whatever; but, nevertheless, as the Czar had deemed it expedient to refer it to them, they accepted the responsibility, and, after having fully investigated the case, were now ready to pronounce judgment.

Agatha Christie___The Secret Adversary.txt,"Tommy was once more confronting bare wooden panels, and the voices within had sunk once more to a mere undistinguishable murmur. Tommy became restive. The conversation he had overheard had stimulated his curiosity. He felt that, by hook or by crook, he must hear more. There was no sound from below, and it did not seem likely that the doorkeeper would come upstairs. After listening intently for a minute or two, he put his head round the curtain. The passage was deserted. Tommy bent down and removed his shoes, then, leaving them behind the curtain, he walked gingerly out on his stockinged feet, and kneeling down by the closed door he laid his ear cautiously to the crack. To his intense annoyance he could distinguish little more; just a chance word here and there if a voice was raised, which merely served to whet his curiosity still farther. He eyed the handle of the door tentatively. Could he turn it by degrees so gently and imperceptibly that those in the room would notice nothing? He decided that with great care it could be done. Very slowly, a fraction of an inch at a time, he moved it round, holding his breath in his excessive care. A little more--a little more still--would it never be finished? Ah! at last it would turn no farther. He stayed so for a minute or two, then drew a deep breath, and pressed it ever so slightly inward. The door did not budge.

A stride and he had reached it. Oh, where was the handle? and oh, if the room should be locked! By a merciful chance it was not. He stepped through the door, knocking Beatrice\'s feet against the framework as he did so, closed it--to shut it he had no time--and stood gasping behind it. The gleam of light drew nearer. Merciful powers! he had been seen--the old man was coming in. What could he say? Tell the truth, that was all; but who would believe such a story? why, it was one that he should scarcely care to advance in a court of law. Could he expect a father to believe it--a father finding a man crouched like a thief behind a door at the dead of night with his lovely daughter senseless in his arms? He had already thought of going straight to Mr. Granger, but had abandoned the idea as hopeless. Who would believe this tale of sleep-walking? For the first time in his life Geoffrey felt terribly afraid, both for Beatrice and himself; the hair rose on his head, his heart stood still, and a cold perspiration started on to his face. ""It\'s very odd,"" he heard the old man mutter to himself; ""I could almost swear that I saw something white go into that room. Where\'s the handle?

This done, he advanced on tiptoe to the open staircase door, passed through it, and secured it on the inner side as usual. Mr. Bashwood had seen him at the apparatus; Mr. Bashwood had noticed the manner of his withdrawal through the staircase door. Again the sense of an unutterable expectation throbbed at his heart. A terror that was slow and cold and deadly crept into his hands, and guided them in the dark to the key that had been left for him in the inner side of the door. He turned it in vague distrust of what might happen next, and waited. The slow minutes passed, and nothing happened. The silence was horrible; the solitude of the lonely corridor was a solitude of invisible treacheries. He began to count to keep his mind employed--to keep his own growing dread away from him. The numbers, as he whispered them, followed each other slowly up to a hundred, and still nothing happened. He had begun the second hundred; he had got on to twenty--when, without a sound to betray that he had been moving in his room, Midwinter suddenly appeared in the corridor. He stood for a moment and listened; he went to the stairs and looked over into the hall beneath.

He closed the window, and, taking off his coat, barricaded the door with all the heaviest furniture in the room. With a feeling of perfect security, he complacently regarded his handiwork, and then, sitting on the edge of the bed, began to undress. He turned the lamp down a little, and reloading the empty chambers of his revolver, placed it by the side of the lamp on the drawers. Then, as he turned back the clothes, he fancied that something moved beneath them. As he paused, it dropped lightly from the other side of the bed to the floor. At first he sat, with knitted brows, trying to see what it was. He had only had a glimpse of it, but he certainly had an idea that it was alive. A rat perhaps. He got off the bed again with an oath, and, taking the lamp in his hand, peered cautiously about the floor. Twice he walked round the room in this fashion. Then he stooped down, and, raising the dirty bed hangings, peered beneath.

Still nothing happened. He increased the pressure. Had the beastly thing stuck? Finally, in desperation, he pushed with all his might. But the door remained firm, and at last the truth dawned upon him. It was locked or bolted on the inside. For a moment or two Tommy's indignation got the better of him. ""Well, I'm damned!"" he said. ""What a dirty trick!"" As his indignation cooled, he prepared to face the situation. Clearly the first thing to be done was to restore the handle to its original position. If he let it go suddenly, the men inside would be almost certain to notice it, so, with the same infinite pains, he reversed his former tactics. All went well, and with a sigh of relief the young man rose to his feet. There was a certain bulldog tenacity about Tommy that made him slow to admit defeat. Checkmated for the moment, he was far from abandoning the conflict. He still intended to hear what was going on in the locked room. As one plan had failed, he must hunt about for another. He looked round him. A little farther along the passage on the left was a second door. He slipped silently along to it. He listened for a moment or two, then tried the handle. It yielded, and he slipped inside.

""It is nothing,"" Tommy insisted, a little fiercely. ""He says so,"" Grizel explained, ""not to alarm us. But he is suffering horribly. Just before I called to you his face was all drawn up in pain."" This made the sufferer wince. ""That was another twinge,"" she said promptly. ""What is to be done, Elspeth?"" ""I think I could carry him,"" suggested Corp, with a forward movement that made Tommy stamp his foot--the wooden one. ""I am all right,"" he told them testily, and looking uneasily at Grizel. ""How brave of you to say so!"" said she. ""It is just like him,"" Elspeth said, pleased with Grizel\'s remark. ""I am sure it is,"" Grizel said, so graciously. It was very naughty of her. Had she given him a chance he would have explained that it was all a mistake of Grizel\'s. That had been his intention; but now a devil entered into Tommy and spoke for him. ""I must have slipped and sprained my ankle,"" he said. ""It is slightly painful; but I shall be able to walk home all right, Corp, if you let me use you as a staff."" I think he was a little surprised to hear himself saying this; but, as soon as it was said, he liked it. He was Captain Stroke playing in the Den again, after all, and playing as well as ever. Nothing being so real to Tommy as pretence, I daresay he even began to feel his ankle hurting', 'have endured more stoically though there had been nothing the matter with it."" ""It was soon over,"" Tommy replied lightly. ""I think Elspeth suffered more than I."" Elspeth told the story of his heroism. ""I could not stay in the room,"" she said; ""it was too terrible."" And Grizel despised too tender-hearted Elspeth for that; she was so courageous at facing pain herself. But Tommy had guessed that Elspeth was trembling behind the door, and he had called out, ""Don\'t cry, Elspeth; I am all right; it is nothing at all."" ""How noble!"" was Grizel\'s comment, when she heard of this; and then Elspeth was her friend again, insisted on her staying to tea, and went into the kitchen to prepare it. Aaron was out. The two were alone now, and in the circumstances some men would have given the lady the opportunity to apologize, if such was her desire. But Tommy\'s was a more generous nature; his manner was that of one less sorry to be misjudged than anxious that Grizel should not suffer too much from remorse. If she had asked his pardon then and there, I am sure he would have replied, ""Right willingly, Grizel,"" and begged her not to give another thought to the matter. What is of more importance, Grizel was sure of this also, and it was the magnanimity of him that especially annoyed her. There seemed to be no disturbing it. Even when she said, ""Which foot is it?"" he answered, ""The one', 'shake Corp by the hand again."" ""And Aaron,"" said Elspeth. She was knitting stockings for Aaron at that moment. ""And Gavinia,"" Tommy said, ""and the Dominie."" ""And Ailie."" And then came an awkward pause, for they were both thinking of that independent girl called Grizel. She was seldom discussed. Tommy was oddly shy about mentioning her name; he would have preferred Elspeth to mention it: and Elspeth had misgivings that this was so, with the result that neither could say ""Grizel"" without wondering what was in the other\'s mind. Tommy had written twice to Grizel, the first time unknown to Elspeth, but that was in the days when the ladies of the penny numbers were disturbing him, and, against his better judgment (for well he knew she would never stand it), he had begun his letter with these mad words: ""Dear Little Woman."" She did not answer this, but soon afterwards she wrote to Elspeth, and he was not mentioned in the letter proper, but it carried a sting in its tail. ""P.S.,"" it said ""How is Sentimental Tommy?"" None but a fiend in human shape could have written thus, and Elspeth put her protecting arms round her brother. ""Now we know what Grizel is,"" she said. ""I am done with her now.""

Like everything else in the house, the furniture was falling to pieces, and the dirt was, if anything, more abundant. But what interested Tommy was the thing he had hoped to find, a communicating door between the two rooms, up on the left by the window. Carefully closing the door into the passage behind him, he stepped across to the other and examined it closely. The bolt was shot across it. It was very rusty, and had clearly not been used for some time. By gently wriggling it to and fro, Tommy managed to draw it back without making too much noise. Then he repeated his former manoeuvres with the handle--this time with complete success. The door swung open--a crack, a mere fraction, but enough for Tommy to hear what went on. There was a velvet portiere on the inside of this door which prevented him from seeing, but he was able to recognize the voices with a reasonable amount of accuracy. The Sinn Feiner was speaking. His rich Irish voice was unmistakable: ""That's all very well. But more money is essential. No money--no results!""

[Dubourgay, 8th January, 1730.] New Year\'s day is not well in, and the ceremonial wishes over, when Friedrich Wilhelm, his mind', 'King, with Bruhl and other chief personages, are withdrawn to Pirna, to the inexpugnable Konigstein and Rock-Country. The Saxon Army had begun assembling there, September 1st, directly on the news that Friedrich was across the Border; September 9th, on Friedrich\'s approach, the King and Dignitaries move off thither, from Dresden, out of his way. Excellency Broglio has put them on that plan. Which may have its complexities for Friedrich, hopes Broglio,--though perhaps its still greater for some other parties concerned! For Bruhl and Polish Majesty, as will appear by and by, nothing could have turned out worse. Meanwhile Friedrich pushes on: ""Forward, all the same."" Polish Majesty, dating from Struppen, in the Pirna Country, has begun a Correspondence with Friedrich, very polite on both hands; and his Adjutant-General, the Chevalier Meagher (""Chevalier de MARRE,"" as Valori calls him,--MA\'AR, as he calls himself in Irish), has just had, at Wilsdruf, an interview with Friedrich; but is far from having got settlement on the terms he wished. Polish Majesty magnanimously assenting to ""a Road through his Country for military purposes;"" offers ""the strictest Neutrality, strictest friendship even; has done, and will do, no injury whatever to his Prussian Majesty--[""Did we ever SIGN anything?"" whisper comfortably Bruhl and he to one another];--expects, therefore, that his Prussian Majesty will march on, whither he is bound; and leave him unmolested here."" [_Helden-Geschichte, _ iii. 774.] That was Meagher\'s message; that is the purport of all his Polish Majesty\'s Eleven Letters to Friedrich, which precede or', 'appearance: no doubt an interesting one to Friedrich, for this and the days next following. Their talk is not reported anywhere: nor is it said with exactitude how far, whether wholly now, or only in part now, Belleisle expounded his sublime ideas to Friedrich; or what precise reception they got. Friedrich himself writes long afterwards of the event; but, as usual, without precision, except in general effect. Now, or some time after, Friedrich says he found Belleisle, one morning, with brow clouded, knit into intense meditation: ""Have you had bad news, M. le Marechal?"" asks Friedrich. ""No, oh no! I am considering what we shall make of that Moravia?""--""Moravia; Hm!"" Friedrich suppresses the glance that is rising to his eyes: ""Can\'t you give it to Saxony, then? Buy Saxony into the Plan with it!"" ""Excellent,"" answers Belleisle, and unpuckers his stern brow again. Friedrich thinks highly, and about this time often says so, of the man Belleisle: but as to the man\'s effulgencies, and wide-winged Plans, none is less seduced by them than Friedrich: ""Your chickens are not hatched, M. le Marechal; some of us hope they never will be,--though the incubation-process may have uses for some of us!"" Friedrich knows that the Kaisership given to any other than Grand-Duke Franz will be mostly an imaginary quantity. ""A grand Symbolic Cloak in the eyes of the vulgar; but empty of all things, empty even of cash, for the last Two Hundred Years: Austria can wear it to advantage; no other']",friedrich - prussian - friedrichs - prussia - wilhelm - prussians - silesian - johann - saxony - reich,0.0,False

""No."" ""Does anyone know where it is?"" ""One person--perhaps. And we are not sure of that even."" ""Who is this person?"" ""A girl."" Tommy held his breath. ""A girl?"" The Russian's voice rose contemptuously. ""And you have not made her speak? In Russia we have ways of making a girl talk."" ""This case is different,"" said the German sullenly. ""How--different?"" He paused a moment, then went on: ""Where is the girl now?"" ""The girl?"" ""Yes."" ""She is----"" But Tommy heard no more. A crashing blow descended on his head, and all was darkness. CHAPTER IX. TUPPENCE ENTERS DOMESTIC SERVICE WHEN Tommy set forth on the trail of the two men, it took all Tuppence's self-command to refrain from accompanying him. However, she contained herself as best she might, consoled by the reflection that her reasoning had been justified by events. The two men had undoubtedly come from the second floor flat, and that one slender thread of the name ""Rita"" had set the Young Adventurers once more upon the track of the abductors of Jane Finn. The question was what to do next? Tuppence hated letting the grass grow under her feet. Tommy was amply employed, and debarred from joining him in the chase, the girl felt at a loose end. She retraced her steps to the entrance hall of the mansions. It was now tenanted by a small",103,Russian Czars and Politics,103_czar_tsar_czars_czare,"['czar', 'tsar', 'czars', 'czare', 'czarina', 'tzar', 'ivan', 'vladimir', 'russian', 'petersburg']","['that he made me of procuring for me the crown of Russia, even with an armed force, I should have spared nothing to have obtained it. ""For instance, if the emperor had demanded that I should afterward furnish him with Russian troops against any of his enemies, in exchange for his service in aiding me, or large sums of money, I should have done whatever he pleased. I would have given great presents to his ministers and generals over and above. In a word, I would have thought nothing too much to have obtained my desire."" This confession, after it was brought to the Czar by Tolstoi, to whom Alexis gave it, was sent by him to the great council of state, to aid them in forming their opinion. The council were occupied for the space of a week in hearing the case, and then they drew up and signed their decision. The statement which they made began by acknowledging that they had not of themselves any original right to try such a question, the Czar himself, according to the ancient constitution of the empire, having sole and exclusive jurisdiction in all such affairs, without being beholden to his subjects in regard to them in any manner whatever; but, nevertheless, as the Czar had deemed it expedient to refer it to them, they accepted the responsibility, and, after having fully investigated the case, were now ready to pronounce judgment. They then proceeded to declare that, after a full hearing and', 'Of course, it was no use my trying to doctor people, when they could not tell me what was the matter with them, and I worked at one thing and another, doing anything I could turn my hands to, for four or five months. That is how I got to pick up Swedish. Then some people told me that Russia was a place where a doctor might get on, for that they had got no doctors for their army who knew anything of surgery, and the czar was always ready to take on foreigners who could teach them anything. I had got my diploma with me, and some of my friends came forward and subscribed enough to rig me out in clothes and pay my passage. What was better, one of them happened to have made the acquaintance of Le Ford, who was, as you may have heard, the czar\'s most intimate friend. ""I wished myself back a hundred times before I reached Moscow, but when I did, everything was easy for me. Le Ford introduced me to the czar, and I was appointed surgeon of a newly-raised regiment, of which Le Ford was colonel.

He glanced round at Tuppence's entry. There was a certain amount of the gamin element in the girl, at all events she invariably got on well with small boys. A sympathetic bond seemed instantly to be formed. She reflected that an ally in the enemy's camp, so to speak, was not to be despised.

With a dramatic gesture she flung back the left side of her coat and exposed a small enamelled badge. It was extremely unlikely that Albert would have any knowledge of it--indeed, it would have been fatal for Tuppence's plans, since the badge in question was the device of a local training corps originated by the archdeacon in the early days of the war.

Five minutes later she smiled contentedly at her reflection in the glass. With an actress's pencil she had slightly altered the line of her eyebrows, and that, taken in conjunction with the new luxuriant growth of fair hair above, so changed her appearance that she felt confident that even if she came face to face with Whittington he would not recognize her. She would wear elevators in her shoes, and the cap and apron would be an even more valuable disguise. From hospital experience she knew only too well that a nurse out of uniform is frequently unrecognized by her patients. ""Yes,"" said Tuppence aloud, nodding at the pert reflection in the glass, ""you'll do."" She then resumed her normal appearance. Dinner was a solitary meal. Tuppence was rather surprised at Tommy's non-return. Julius, too, was absent--but that to the girl's mind was more easily explained. His ""hustling"" activities were not confined to London, and his abrupt appearances and disappearances were fully accepted by the Young Adventurers as part of the day's work. It was quite on the cards that Julius P. Hersheimmer had left for Constantinople at a moment's notice if he fancied that a clue to his cousin's disappearance was to be found there.

His long thin face was laced and seamed with wrinkles, crossing and recrossing everywhere, but fanning out in hundreds from the corners of his eyes. It was set in an unchanging expression, and as it was of the same colour all over, as dark as the darkest walnut, it might have been some quaint figure-head cut out of a coarse-grained wood. He was clad in a blue serge jacket, a pair of red breeches smeared at the knees with tar, clean gray worsted stockings, large steel buckles over his coarse square-toed shoes, and beside him, balanced upon the top of a thick oaken cudgel, was a weather-stained silver-laced hat. His gray-shot hair was gathered up behind into a short stiff tail, and a seaman's hanger, with a brass handle, was girded to his waist by a tarnished leather belt. De Catinat had been too occupied to take notice of this singular individual, but Amos Green gave a shout of delight at the sight of him, and ran forward to greet him.

The track or footpath along which they ran was so narrow as to compel them to advance in single file. He who led was a tall agile youth of nineteen or thereabouts, in knickerbocker shooting-garb, with short curly black hair, pleasantly expressive features, and sinewy frame. The second was obviously a true-blue tar--a regular sea-dog--about thirty years of age, of Samsonian mould, and, albeit running for very life, with grand indignation gleaming in his eyes. He wore a blue shirt on his broad back, white ducks on his active legs, and a straw hat on his head, besides a mass of shaggy hair, which, apparently, not finding enough of room on his cranium, overflowed in two brown cataracts down his cheeks, and terminated in a voluminous beard. The third fugitive was also a young man, and a negro, short, thickset, square, tough as india-rubber, and black as the Emperor of Zahara. Good-humour wrinkled the corners of his eyes, the milk of human kindness played on his thick lips and rippled his sable brow, and intense sincerity, like a sunbeam, suffused his entire visage. James Ginger--for that was his name, though his friends preferred to call him Ebony--scorned a hat of any kind; his simple costume consisting merely of two garments--canvas trousers and a guernsey shirt. The sailor wore a cutlass in his belt. Ebony was unarmed. The youthful leader carried a short fowling-piece. A yell in the far distance, as if from a hundred fiends, told that', 'He had little hair, which was powdered, and dressed in a manner to render more remarkable the elevation of his conical and polished forehead. His long piercing black eyes were almost closed, from the fullness of their upper lids. His cheek was sallow, his nose aquiline, his mouth compressed. His ears, which were uncovered, were so small that it would be wrong to pass them over unnoticed; as, indeed, were his hands and feet, in form quite feminine. He was dressed in a coat and waistcoat of black velvet, the latter part of his costume reaching to his thighs; and in a button-hole of his coat was a large bunch of tube-rose. The broad collar of his exquisitely plaited shirt, though tied round with a wide black ribbon, did not conceal a neck which agreed well with his beardless chin, and would not have misbecome a woman. In England we should have called his breeches buckskin. They were of a pale yellow leather, and suited his large and spur-armed cavalry boots, which fitted closely to the legs they covered, reaching over the knees of the wearer. A ribbon round his neck, tucked into his waistcoat pocket, was attached to a small French watch. He swung in his right hand the bow of a violin; and in the other, the little finger of which was nearly hid by a large antique ring, he held a white handkerchief strongly perfumed with violets.

Tommy might have wired, or something. I wonder where he is. Anyway, he can't have 'lost the trail' as they say.

Ten minutes later the lady was ensconced comfortably on her bed, smoking cigarettes and deep in the perusal of Garnaby Williams, the Boy Detective, which, with other threepenny works of lurid fiction, she had sent out to purchase. She felt, and rightly, that before the strain of attempting further intercourse with Albert, it would be as well to fortify herself with a good supply of local colour.

""Why did you do it?"" ""I thought you might save Gregory, if I told you."" ""That was all?"" Sally looked at her with incredulous eyes. ""No,"" answered Agatha simply, ""that was only part. It did not seem right that Gregory should go against Wyllard\'s wishes, and gamble the Range away on the wheat market."" She admitted it without hesitation, for she realized now exactly what had animated her to seek this painful interview. She was fighting Wyllard\'s battle, and that fact sustained her. Sally winced.

As soon as they were sure they could reach him, she said, they would write to him again. Adeline wrote a few lines with her name, to say that for some days past she had not been quite well; but that she was better and had nothing to wish for but to hear from him. When Pinney came back a second time, he found Northwick with the letter open in his hand. ""Well, sir,"" he said, with the easy respectfulness toward Northwick that had been replacing, ever since he talked with Matt Hilary, the hail-fellow manner he used with most men, and that had now fully established itself, ""You\'ve got some noble scenery about here."" He meant to compliment Northwick on the beauty of the landscape, as people ascribe merit to the inhabitants of a flourishing city.

He had used his influence, the weight of his character and business repute, to control the action of the Board towards Northwick, when the defalcation became known, and now he was doubly bound to respond to the wishes of the directors in proceeding against him. Most of them believed that Northwick was still alive; those who were not sure regarded it as a public duty to have him indicted at any rate, and they all voted that Hilary should make the necessary complaint.

Her exquisite figure was enhanced by a wonderful gown of indigo charmeuse. And yet, despite her swaying grace, and the almost ethereal beauty of her face, you felt instinctively the presence of something hard and menacing, a kind of metallic strength that found expression in the tones of her voice and in that gimlet-like quality of her eyes. For the first time Tuppence felt afraid. She had not feared Whittington, but this woman was different. As if fascinated, she watched the long cruel line of the red curving mouth, and again she felt that sensation of panic pass over her. Her usual self-confidence deserted her. Vaguely she felt that deceiving this woman would be very different to deceiving Whittington. Mr. Carter's warning recurred to her mind. Here, indeed, she might expect no mercy. Fighting down that instinct of panic which urged her to turn tail and run without further delay, Tuppence returned the lady's gaze firmly and respectfully. As though that first scrutiny had been satisfactory, Mrs. Vandemeyer motioned to a chair. ""You can sit down. How did you hear I wanted a house-parlourmaid?""

They were also experts in training a ""raw girl,"" the inevitable result being that the raw girl, once trained, departed elsewhere where her newly acquired knowledge commanded a more substantial remuneration than the archdeacon's meagre purse allowed. Tuppence had therefore very little fear of proving inefficient. Mrs. Vandemeyer's cook puzzled her. She evidently went in deadly terror of her mistress. The girl thought it probable that the other woman had some hold over her. For the rest, she cooked like a chef, as Tuppence had an opportunity of judging that evening. Mrs. Vandemeyer was expecting a guest to dinner, and Tuppence accordingly laid the beautifully polished table for two. She was a little exercised in her own mind as to this visitor. It was highly possible that it might prove to be Whittington. Although she felt fairly confident that he would not recognize her, yet she would have been better pleased had the guest proved to be a total stranger. However, there was nothing for it but to hope for the best. At a few minutes past eight the front door bell rang, and Tuppence went to answer it with some inward trepidation. She was relieved to see that the visitor was the second of the two men whom Tommy had taken upon himself to follow. He gave his name as Count Stepanov.

Mr. Crawley had now made up his mind that as long as it was possible he would ignore the presence of Mrs. Proudie altogether; and, therefore, he made no sign that he had heard the latter remark. ""It has been most unfortunate,"" continued the bishop. ""I have never before had a clergyman in my diocese placed in so distressing a position."" ""That is a matter of opinion, my lord,"" said Mr. Crawley, who at that moment thought of a crisis which had come in the life of another clergyman in the diocese of Barchester, with the circumstances of which he had by chance been made acquainted. ""Exactly,"" said the bishop. ""And I am expressing my opinion."" Mr. Crawley, who understood fighting, did not think that the time had yet come for striking a blow, so he simply bowed again. ""A most unfortunate position, Mr. Crawley,"" continued the bishop. ""Far be it from me to express an opinion upon the matter, which will have to come before a jury of your countrymen. It is enough for me to know that the magistrates assembled at Silverbridge, gentlemen to whom no doubt you must be known, as most of them live in your neighbourhood, have heard evidence upon the subject--"" ""Most convincing evidence,"" said Mrs. Proudie, interrupting her husband. Mr. Crawley\'s black brow became a little blacker as he heard the word, but still he ignored the woman. He not only did not speak, but', ""his own over his head. Such being the state of Mr. Harding's mind in the matter, he did not feel any peculiar personal interest in the appointment of Dr. Proudie to the bishopric. He, as well as others at Barchester, regretted that a man should be sent among them who, they were aware, was not of their way of thinking; but Mr. Harding himself was not a bigoted man on points of church doctrine, and he was quite prepared to welcome Dr. Proudie to Barchester in a graceful and becoming manner. He had nothing to seek and nothing to fear; he felt that it behoved him to be on good terms with his bishop, and he did not anticipate any obstacle that would prevent it. In such a frame of mind he proceeded to pay his respects at the palace the second day after the arrival of the bishop and his chaplain. But he did not go alone. Dr. Grantly proposed to accompany him, and Mr. Harding was not sorry to have a companion, who would remove from his shoulders the burden of the conversation in such an interview. In the affair of the consecration Dr. Grantly had been introduced to the bishop, and Mr. Harding had also been there. He had, however, kept himself in the background, and he was now to be presented to the great man for the first time. The archdeacon's feelings were of a much stronger nature. He was not exactly the man to overlook"", ""of all of them was supreme. The Master of Lazarus had been successful in his attempt, and success is dear to us all. The archdeacon had trampled upon Mr. Slope, and had lifted to high honours the young clergyman whom he had induced to quit the retirement and comfort of the university. So at least the archdeacon thought; though, to speak sooth, not he, but circumstances, had trampled on Mr. Slope. But the satisfaction of Mr. Harding was, of all, perhaps, the most complete. He laid aside his usual melancholy manner and brought forth little quiet jokes from the inmost mirth of his heart; he poked his fun at the archdeacon about Mr. Slope's marriage and quizzed him for his improper love for Mrs. Proudie. On the following day they all returned to Barchester. It was arranged that Mr. Arabin should know nothing of what had been done till he received the minister's letter from the hands of his embryo father-in-law. In order that no time might be lost, a message had been sent to him by the preceding night's post, begging him to be at the deanery at the hour that the train from London arrived.

Whilst waiting at table, Tuppence listened closely to all that was said. She remembered that this was one of the men Tommy was shadowing when she had last seen him. Already, although she would hardly admit it, she was becoming uneasy about her partner. Where was he? Why had no word of any kind come from him? She had arranged before leaving the Ritz to have all letters or messages sent on at once by special messenger to a small stationer's shop near at hand where Albert was to call in frequently. True, it was only yesterday morning that she had parted from Tommy, and she told herself that any anxiety on his behalf would be absurd. Still, it was strange that he had sent no word of any kind.

""In that case he will in all probability do it; but I don\'t think you need feel diffident about meeting him, especially as you can\'t help it.

It did not seem right that Gregory should go against Wyllard\'s wishes, and gamble the Range away on the wheat market."" She admitted it without hesitation, for she realized now exactly what had animated her to seek this painful interview. She was fighting Wyllard\'s battle, and that fact sustained her. Sally winced. ""Yes"" she agreed, ""I guess you had to tell me. He was fond of you. One could be proud of that. Harry Wyllard never did anything low down and mean."" Agatha did not resent her candor.

The council were occupied for the space of a week in hearing the case, and then they drew up and signed their decision. The statement which they made began by acknowledging that they had not of themselves any original right to try such a question, the Czar himself, according to the ancient constitution of the empire, having sole and exclusive jurisdiction in all such affairs, without being beholden to his subjects in regard to them in any manner whatever; but, nevertheless, as the Czar had deemed it expedient to refer it to them, they accepted the responsibility, and, after having fully investigated the case, were now ready to pronounce judgment.

She looked at him with renewed interest. This, then, was the famous K.C. whose name was familiar all over England. She had heard it said that he might one day be Prime Minister.

This according to custom was to be held at two o’clock in the afternoon, to choose their chairman for the session. Before the choice was made, both the leader and his political friends should know the view and the purpose that prevailed in the camp of their allies. Mr. Parnell kept himself invisible and inaccessible alike to English and Irish friends until a few minutes before the meeting. The Irish member who had seen Mr. Gladstone the previous evening, at the last moment was able to deliver the message that had been confided to him. Mr. Parnell replied that he should stand to his guns. The other members of the Irish party came together, and, wholly ignorant of the attitude taken by Mr. Gladstone, promptly and with hardly a word of discussion re-elected their leader to his usual post. The gravity of the unfortunate error (M155) committed in the failure to communicate the private message to the whole of the nationalist members, with or without Mr. Parnell’s leave, lay in the fact that it magnified and distorted Mr. Gladstone’s later intervention into a humiliating public ultimatum.

Foreign politics seemed to have the chief place in his mind. _May 31._--Gladstone has seen Palmerston, and said he will not vote against Lord Derby in support of Lord John's supposed motion.

Philip broke his silence at last. ""I want to be left alone,"" he said. ""Philip, how can you say anything so unkind? Don\'t you know that your uncle and I only want your good? Don\'t you love me at all?"" ""I hate you. I wish you was dead."" Mrs. Carey gasped. He said the words so savagely that it gave her quite a start. She had nothing to say.

He adopted an appropriate manner. ""I\'m afraid it is the end this time, Philip,"" he said. ""It\'ll be a great loss to all of us. I\'ve known him for five-and-thirty years.""

One day, quite suddenly, he asked Philip if he would walk to the football field with him. Philip flushed. ""I can\'t walk fast enough for you,"" he said. ""Rot. Come on."" And just before they were setting out some boy put his head in the study-door and asked Rose to go with him. ""I can\'t,"" he answered. ""I\'ve already promised Carey."" ""Don\'t bother about me,"" said Philip quickly. ""I shan\'t mind."" ""Rot,"" said Rose. He looked at Philip with those good-natured eyes of his and laughed. Philip felt a curious tremor in his heart. In a little while, their friendship growing with boyish rapidity, the pair were inseparable. Other fellows wondered at the sudden intimacy, and Rose was asked what he saw in Philip. ""Oh, I']",philip - phil - carey - vicar - little - felt - philips - mrs - hollywell - room,0.0,False

Mr. Sabin\'s cold voice recalled him to himself. ""I believe,"" he said, ""that I overheard your name correctly. It is Wolfenden, is it not?"" Wolfenden assented. ""I am sorry that I haven\'t a card,"" he said. ""That is my name."" Mr. Sabin looked at him curiously. ""Wolfenden is, I believe, the family name of the Deringhams? May I ask, are you any relation to Admiral Lord Deringham?"" Wolfenden was suddenly grave. ""Yes,"" he answered; ""he is my father. Did you ever meet him?"" Mr. Sabin shook his head. ""No, I have heard of him abroad; also, I believe, of the Countess of Deringham,', 'your aid last night.

The train was just off. First thing I knew a guard came along and informed me mighty politely that I wasn't in a smoking-carriage. I handed him out half a dollar, and that settled that. I did a bit of prospecting along the corridor to the next coach. Whittington was there right enough. When I saw the skunk, with his big sleek fat face, and thought of poor little Jane in his clutches, I felt real mad that I hadn't got a gun with me. I'd have tickled him up some. ""We got to Bournemouth all right. Whittington took a cab and gave the name of an hotel. I did likewise, and we drove up within three minutes of each other. He hired a room, and I hired one too.

Mrs. Pomfret, still protesting against the profane interruption to Mr. Crewe\'s speech, bent her head to enter Mr. Crewe\'s booby sleigh, which had his crest on the panel. Alice was hustled in next, but Victoria avoided his ready assistance and got in herself, Mr. Crewe getting in beside her. ""Au revoir,"" she called out to Austen, as the door slammed. The coachman gathered his horses together, and off they went at a brisk trot. Then the little group which had been watching the performance dispersed. Halfway across the park Austen perceived some one signaling violently to him, and discovered his friend, young Tom Gaylord. ""Come to dinner with me,"" said young Tom, ""and tell me whether the speech of your friend from Leith will send him to Congress. I saw you hobnobbing with him just now. What\'s the matter, Austen? I haven\'t seen that guilty expression on your face since we were at college together."" ""What\'s the best livery-stable in town?"" Austen asked. ""By George, I wondered why you came down here.

Well, your father has one decided consolation; you have fulfilled his hope that you would settle down here and practise in the State. And I hear that you are fast forging to the front.

""And on the occasion when you did me the honour to call on me,"" said Mr. Flint, ""if I remember rightly, you expressed some rather radical views--for the son of Hilary Vane."" ""For the son of Hilary Vane,"" Austen agreed, with a smile. Mr. Flint ignored the implication in the repetition. ""Thinking as mach as I do of Mr. Vane, I confess that your views at that time rather disturbed me. It is a matter of relief to learn that you have refused to lend yourself to the schemes of men like our neighbour, Mr. Humphrey Crewe, of Leith."" ""Honesty compels me to admit,"" answered Austen, ""that I did not refrain on Mr. Crewe\'s account."" ""Although,"" said Mr. Flint, drumming on the table, ""there was some talk that you were to be brought forward as a dark horse in the convention, and as a candidate unfriendly to the interests of the Northeastern Railroads, I am glad you did not consent to be put in any such position.

Merciful powers! he had been seen--the old man was coming in. What could he say? Tell the truth, that was all; but who would believe such a story? why, it was one that he should scarcely care to advance in a court of law. Could he expect a father to believe it--a father finding a man crouched like a thief behind a door at the dead of night with his lovely daughter senseless in his arms? He had already thought of going straight to Mr. Granger, but had abandoned the idea as hopeless. Who would believe this tale of sleep-walking? For the first time in his life Geoffrey felt terribly afraid, both for Beatrice and himself; the hair rose on his head, his heart stood still, and a cold perspiration started on to his face. ""It\'s very odd,"" he heard the old man mutter to himself; ""I could almost swear that I saw something white go into that room. Where\'s the handle? If I believed in ghosts--hullo! my candle has blown', 'ceased. He took a long purple bottle out, examined it by the gas-light, put it back, and closed the case. This done, he advanced on tiptoe to the open staircase door, passed through it, and secured it on the inner side as usual. Mr. Bashwood had seen him at the apparatus; Mr. Bashwood had noticed the manner of his withdrawal through the staircase door. Again the sense of an unutterable expectation throbbed at his heart. A terror that was slow and cold and deadly crept into his hands, and guided them in the dark to the key that had been left for him in the inner side of the door. He turned it in vague distrust of what might happen next, and waited. The slow minutes passed, and nothing happened. The silence was horrible; the solitude of the lonely corridor was a solitude of invisible treacheries. He began to count to keep his mind employed--to keep his own growing dread away from him. The numbers, as he whispered them, followed each other slowly up to a hundred, and still nothing happened. He had begun the second hundred; he had got on to twenty--when, without a sound to betray that he had been moving in his room, Midwinter suddenly appeared in the corridor. He stood for a moment and listened; he went to the stairs and looked over into the hall beneath. Then, for the second time that night, he tried the staircase door, and for the second time found it', 'door again, resolutely turned back and went upstairs. His first proceeding upon entering his room was to carefully look beneath and behind the heavy, dusty pieces of furniture, and, satisfied that no foe lurked there, he closed the door and locked it Then he opened the window gently, and listened The court below was perfectly still. He closed the window, and, taking off his coat, barricaded the door with all the heaviest furniture in the room. With a feeling of perfect security, he complacently regarded his handiwork, and then, sitting on the edge of the bed, began to undress. He turned the lamp down a little, and reloading the empty chambers of his revolver, placed it by the side of the lamp on the drawers. Then, as he turned back the clothes, he fancied that something moved beneath them. As he paused, it dropped lightly from the other side of the bed to the floor. At first he sat, with knitted brows, trying to see what it was. He had only had a glimpse of it, but he certainly had an idea that it was alive. A rat perhaps. He got off the bed again with an oath, and, taking the lamp in his hand, peered cautiously about the floor. Twice he walked round the room in this fashion. Then he stooped down, and, raising the dirty bed hangings, peered beneath.

""I guess he\'s been standing by you, Mr. Northwick, as far as he consistently could,"" he said; and Northwick ventured to reply that he expected that. ""It was young Hilary who brought me the letter, and talked the whole thing up with me,"" Pinney added. Northwick had apparently not expected this; but he let no more than the fact appear.

He had used his influence, the weight of his character and business repute, to control the action of the Board towards Northwick, when the defalcation became known, and now he was doubly bound to respond to the wishes of the directors in proceeding against him. Most of them believed that Northwick was still alive; those who were not sure regarded it as a public duty to have him indicted at any rate, and they all voted that Hilary should make the necessary complaint. Then Hilary had no choice but to obey. Another man in his place might have resigned, but he could not, for he knew that he was finally responsible for Northwick's escape. He made it no less his duty to find out just how much hardship it would work Northwick's daughters, and he tried to lend them money. But Suzette answered for both that her father had left them some money when he went away; and Hilary could only send Louise to explain how he must formally appear in the legal proceedings; he allowed Louise to put whatever warmth of color she wished into his regrets and into his advice that they should consult a lawyer.

""Then I shouldn't."" ""Why?"" ""Just an idea of mine."" ""Oh; but he must do something. There's no one else. By the way, I forgot to tell you of a queer thing that happened this morning.""

""But I think that, in an ambiguous, legal, without prejudishish lawyer's way, he was trying to warn me."" ""Why should he?"" ""I don't know,"" confessed Tuppence. ""But he looked kind, and simply awfully clever. I wouldn't mind going to him and telling him everything."" Somewhat to her surprise, Julius negatived the idea sharply. ""See here,"" he said, ""we don't want any lawyers mixed up in this. That guy couldn't help us any."" ""Well, I believe he could,"" reiterated Tuppence obstinately. ""Don't you think it. So long. I'll be back in half an hour."" Thirty-five minutes had elapsed when Julius returned. He took Tuppence by the arm, and walked her to the window. ""There she is.""

Blanche looked round at the sleeping Geoffrey. ""And _he_ knows!"" she said. ""It\'s maddening, uncle, to look at the brute snoring in his chair!"" Sir Patrick held up a warning hand. Before a word more could be said between them they were silenced again by another interruption. The whist-party comprised Lady Lundie and the surgeon, playing as partners against Smith and Jones. Arnold sat behind the surgeon, taking a lesson in the game. One, Two, and Three, thus left to their own devices, naturally thought of the billiard-table; and, detecting Geoffrey asleep in his corner, advanced to disturb his slumbers, under the all-sufficing apology of ""Pool."" Geoffrey roused himself, and rubbed his eyes, and said, drowsily, ""All right."" As he rose, he looked at the opposite corner in which Sir Patrick and his niece were sitting. Blanche\'s self-possession, resolutely as she struggled to preserve it, was not strong enough to keep her eyes from turning toward Geoffrey with an expression which betrayed the reluctant interest that she now felt in him. He stopped, noticing something entirely new in the look with which the young lady was regarding him. ""Beg your pardon,"" said Geoffrey. ""Do you wish to speak to me?"" Blanche\'s face flushed all over. Her uncle came to the rescue. ""Miss Lundie and I hope you have slept well Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick, jocosely. ""That\'s all."" ""Oh? That\'s all?"" said Geoffrey still', 'looked like himself again. ""Why go indoors this lovely weather?"" he said. ""Suppose we take a turn in the garden?"" Blanche pressed Anne\'s hand significantly. The proposal was evidently made for a purpose. They turned the corner of the cottage and gained the large garden at the back--the two ladies walking together, arm in arm; Sir Patrick and Geoffrey following them. Little by little, Blanche quickened her pace. ""I have got my instructions,"" she whispered to Anne. ""Let\'s get out of his hearing."" It was more easily said than done. Geoffrey kept close behind them. ""Consider my lameness, Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick. ""Not quite so fast."" It was well intended. But Geoffrey\'s cunning had taken the alarm. Instead of dropping behind with Sir Patrick, he called to his wife. ""Consider Sir Patrick\'s lameness,"" he repeated. ""Not quite so fast."" Sir Patrick met that check with characteristic readiness. When Anne slackened her pace, he addressed himself to Geoffrey, stopping deliberately in the middle of the path. ""Let me give you my message from Holchester House,"" he said. The two ladies were still slowly walking on. Geoffrey was placed between the alternatives of staying with Sir Patrick and leaving them by themselves--or of following them and leaving Sir Patrick. Deliberately, on his side, he followed the ladies. Sir Patrick called him back. ""I told you I wished to speak to you,"" he said, sharply. Driven to bay, Geoffrey openly revealed his resolution to give Blanche no opportunity of speaking in private', 'look at Anne. The look was not returned--was not even seen. From the moment when she had taken her place by Sir Patrick, Anne\'s eyes had rested on Blanche. They never moved--they never for an instant lost their tender sadness--when the woman who hated her spoke. All that was beautiful and true in that noble nature seemed to find its one sufficient encouragement in Blanche. As she looked once more at the sister of the unforgotten days of old, its native beauty of expression shone out again in her worn and weary face. Every man in the room (but Geoffrey) looked at her; and every man (but Geoffrey) felt for her. Sir Patrick addressed a second question to his sister-in-law. ""Is there any one here to represent the interests of Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn?"" he asked. Lady Lundie referred Sir Patrick to Geoffrey himself. Without looking up, Geoffrey motioned with his big brown hand to Mr. Moy, sitting by his side. Mr. Moy (holding the legal rank in Scotland which corresponds to the rank held by solicitors in England) rose and bowed to Sir Patrick, with the courtesy due to a man eminent in his time at the Scottish Bar. ""I represent Mr. Delamayn,"" he said. ""I congratulate myself, Sir Patrick, on having your ability and experience to appeal to in the conduct of the pending inquiry.""

""She was just being sent home to some bigwig."" ""Well?"" ""I went round to his house,"" said Julius. ""I said that I reckoned a car like that was worth every penny of twenty thousand dollars. Then I told him that it was worth just about fifty thousand dollars to me if he'd get out."" ""Well?"" said Tuppence, intoxicated. ""Well,"" returned Julius, ""he got out, that's all."" CHAPTER XII. A FRIEND IN NEED FRIDAY and Saturday passed uneventfully. Tuppence had received a brief answer to her appeal from Mr. Carter. In it he pointed out that the Young Adventurers had undertaken the work at their own risk, and had been fully warned of the dangers. If anything had happened to Tommy he regretted it deeply, but he could do nothing. This was cold comfort. Somehow, without Tommy, all the savour went out of the adventure, and, for the first time, Tuppence felt doubtful of success. While they had been together she had never questioned it for a minute. Although she was accustomed to take the lead, and to pride herself on her quick-wittedness, in reality she had relied upon Tommy more than she realized at the time. There was something so eminently sober and clear-headed about him, his common sense and soundness of vision were so unvarying, that without him Tuppence felt much like a rudderless ship. It was curious that",37,Money and financial transactions,37_shillings_cents_dollar_cash,"['shillings', 'cents', 'dollar', 'cash', 'dollars', 'bank', 'thousand', 'cent', 'guineas', 'money']","['Mr. Low. ""We wanted to see you for ever so many reasons. Of course you understand that--that any sum of money can be spent that the case may want.""

We would send all round the world if we could get evidence against that other man,--Lady Eustace\'s husband, you know."" ""Can any good be done by sending all round the world?"" ""He went back to his own home not long ago,--in Poland, I think,"" said Madame Goesler. ""Perhaps he got the instrument there, and brought it with him."" Mr. Low shook his head. ""Of course we are very ignorant;--but it would be a pity that everything should not be tried."" ""He might have got in and out of the window, you know,"" said the Duchess. Still Mr. Low shook his head. ""I believe things can always be found out, if only you take trouble enough. And trouble means money;--does it not? We wouldn\'t mind how many thousand pounds it cost; would we, Marie?"" ""I fear that the spending of thousands can do no good,"" said Mr. Low. ""But something must be done.

Now, what is the interest of eight millions of dollars, say at three per cent.?"" Rollo began to calculate it in his mind; but before he had got through, Mr. George said that it was two hundred and forty thousand dollars a year. ""That,"" said Mr. George, ""is equal, with a proper allowance for repairs, to, say a thousand dollars per day. Now, do you think that the people who will come here to see it will get pleasure enough from it to amount in all to a thousand dollars a day?"" ""I don\'t know,"" said Rollo, doubtfully. ""I\'d give one dollar, I know, to see it."" ""Yes,"" said Mr. George, ""so would I; and I do not know but that there would be three hundred thousand to come in a year, including all the great occasions that would bring out immense assemblages from all the surrounding country."" ""At any rate, I hope they will finish it,"" said Rollo. ""So do I,"" said Mr. George. ""And I mean to put a little in the man\'s plate when I go down,"" said Rollo, ""and then I shall have a share in it."" ""I will too,"" said Mr. George. Accordingly, as they passed by the man when they were leaving the church, Mr. George put a franc into his plate, and Rollo half a franc. Just at the time that they put their money in, the party that Minnie belonged to came by, and the gentleman put in a silver coin', 'more prosperous one in the city."" At the close of the week came visitors--Frank, Doc Linyard, and a strange gentleman, who was introduced as Mr. Styles, the old sailor\'s lawyer friend.

It was glorious news. ""Sure?"" asked Mrs. Dare, with tears in her eyes. ""Positive, madam,"" replied Mr. Styles. ""I will buy the claim for two thousand dollars if you need the money,"" he whispered. ""No, thank you; I can wait,"" she replied.

Agatha Christie___The Secret Adversary.txt,"Julius, who was undoubtedly much cleverer than Tommy, did not give her the same feeling of support. She had accused Tommy of being a pessimist, and it is certain that he always saw the disadvantages and difficulties which she herself was optimistically given to overlooking, but nevertheless she had really relied a good deal on his judgment. He might be slow, but he was very sure. It seemed to the girl that, for the first time, she realized the sinister character of the mission they had undertaken so lightheartedly. It had begun like a page of romance. Now, shorn of its glamour, it seemed to be turning to grim reality. Tommy--that was all that mattered. Many times in the day Tuppence blinked the tears out of her eyes resolutely. ""Little fool,"" she would apostrophize herself, ""don't snivel. Of course you're fond of him. You've known him all your life. But there's no need to be sentimental about it."" In the meantime, nothing more was seen of Boris. He did not come to the flat, and Julius and the car waited in vain. Tuppence gave herself over to new meditations. Whilst admitting the truth of Julius's objections, she had nevertheless not entirely relinquished the idea of appealing to Sir James Peel Edgerton. Indeed, she had gone so far as to look up his address in the Red Book. Had he meant to warn her that day? If so, why? Surely she was at least entitled to demand an explanation. He had",98,Interpersonal relationships and social dynamics among characters in a story,98_nick_miriam_miriams_biddy,"['nick', 'miriam', 'miriams', 'biddy', 'peter', 'madame', 'nicks', 'julia', 'grace', 'mrs']","['Nick, who was absent; she remembered how they had met in Paris and how little he had succeeded with them. When she had asked Biddy afterwards how she could receive him that way Biddy had replied that even she, Grace, would have some charity for him if she could hear how fond he was of poor Nick. He had talked to her only of Nick--of nothing else. Grace had observed how she spoke of Nick as injured, and had noted the implication that some one else, ceasing to be fond of him, was thereby condemned in Biddy\'s eyes. It seemed to Grace that some one else had at least a right not to like some of his friends. The studio struck her as mean and horrid; and so far from suggesting to her that it could have played a part in making Nick and Julia fall out she only felt how little its dusty want of consequence, could count, one way or the other, for Julia. Grace, who had no opinions on art, saw no merit whatever in those ""impressions"" on canvas from Nick\'s hand with which the place was bestrewn. She didn\'t at all wish her brother to have talent in that direction, yet it was secretly humiliating to her that he hadn\'t more. Nick meanwhile felt a pang of almost horrified penitence, in the little room on the right of the hall, the moment after he had made his mother really understand he had thrown up his scat', 'drag him,"" Nick returned.

""Yes, as you say,"" her mother mused at their host, ""the question of marriage has ceased to exist for you."" ""Mamma goes straight at it!"" laughed the girl, getting up while Nick rubbed his canvas before answering. Miriam went to mamma and settled her bonnet and mantle in preparation for her drive, then stood a moment with a filial arm about her and as if waiting for their friend\'s explanation. This, however, when it came halted visibly. ""Why you said a while ago that if Peter was there you wouldn\'t act."" ""I\'ll act for _him_,"" smiled Miriam, inconsequently caressing her mother. ""It doesn\'t matter whom it\'s for!"" Mrs. Rooth declared sagaciously. ""Take your drive and relax your mind,"" said the girl, kissing her. ""Come for me in an hour; not later--but not sooner."" She went with her to the door, bundled her out, closed it behind her and came back to the position she had quitted. ""_This_ is the peace I want!"" she gratefully cried as she settled into it.

Anyway, Tuppence decided, with her usual shake of the shoulders, it was worth trying, and try it she would. Sunday was her afternoon out. She would meet Julius, persuade him to her point of view, and they would beard the lion in his den. When the day arrived Julius needed a considerable amount of persuading, but Tuppence held firm. ""It can do no harm,"" was what she always came back to. In the end Julius gave in, and they proceeded in the car to Carlton House Terrace. The door was opened by an irreproachable butler. Tuppence felt a little nervous. After all, perhaps it WAS colossal cheek on her part. She had decided not to ask if Sir James was ""at home,"" but to adopt a more personal attitude. ""Will you ask Sir James if I can see him for a few minutes? I have an important message for him."" The butler retired, returning a moment or two later. ""Sir James will see you. Will you step this way?"" He ushered them into a room at the back of the house, furnished as a library.

Lance, beginning to recover, put his arms round Cherry's neck, gave her a tremendous hug, released himself from his brother's arms, and ran off to bed. Felix remained a few moments, while Cherry exclaimed, 'Oh! the dear good little fellow!' 'Better than any of us,' said Felix. 'I was quite savage with Mr. Audley when I found out about it. I must go down and tell him. I never thought all that was in the little chap! I'm glad he came to you, Cherry. Good-night.' 'And you will try to teach this poor boy, Felix?' 'I don't say that. I don't in the least know how; but I shall not dare to hinder Lance, now I see how he goes on.' On his way down he heard voices in the sitting-room, where, in fact, Mr. Audley had joined Wilmet, to explain to her how vexed he was to have so much annoyed Felix, and perhaps also something of his own annoyance at the manner in which Felix took it. Wilmet, partly from her 'growing on the sunny side of the wall,' partly from her early authority, was in some ways older than her brother, and could see that there was in him a shade of boyish jealousy of his prerogative; and as she sat, in her"", ""she said little of her fears, knowing the importance of Wilmet's having and enjoying her holiday; and Mr. Audley promised extra aid in keeping order among the boys. But as they came in that evening from the practice at the church, to which Clement had insisted on their coming to hear Lance, Mr. Audley beckoned Felix to his room with the words, 'There's a thing I want to talk over with you.' Felix recollected those ominous words to Mr. Underwood, and stood warming his hands in dread of what might be coming. It was all he feared. 'I wanted to say--I wanted to tell you--' began Mr. Audley. 'I would not have chosen this time, but that I think it may save Wilmet something to be able to tell her friends that the present arrangement is to cease.' 'Wilmet!' exclaimed Felix; then bethinking himself. 'Was _that_ what Tom Underwood meant? But you will not trouble yourself about such rubbish.' 'Well, you see,' began the Curate, with heightening colour, 'it can't be denied that your sister _has_ grown up, and that things are changed.' 'Mrs. Froggatt _did_ ask me if you were going on here,' said Felix, still unconvinced; 'but can't we leave people to be _stoopid_ without interfering with us?' 'Felix, you ought to be a better protector to your sisters. You would not like to have my Lady remonstrating--nay, maybe writing to my mother: she is quite capable of it.' Felix's cheeks were in a flame. 'If people would"", ""'Little Cherry is the cleverest of us all,' added Felix. 'Still,' said the Sister, 'the mere going over your work with you will give her change and interest. I do feel strongly convinced; dear Wilmet, that to shut yourself up with her, without gathering anything from elsewhere, would be very bad for both.' 'We must see how Mamma is, and how Cherry gets on,' was all that Wilmet would say, but the arrangement was made, and was to take effect in ten days' time, when Mr. Mowbray Smith was coming to be second curate, and Sister Constance must change places with the three absent children, and Alda would be gone to her adopted home. Then Mr. Audley took leave; and as Felix went to the front door with him, he said, 'Forgive me, Felix; but I am a younger brother myself, and I do hope you do not mean to assert your authority by licking.' Felix coloured a little; and though he spoke respectfully, it was with some little annoyance. 'There is nothing else that does with Fulbert.' 'Stay, Felix; I am not questioning that he may be the sort of boy for whom flogging may be good from some one.' 'He is!' said Felix. 'He never will behave himself till he has felt his master!

At any rate, she decided, it would do no harm just to go and LOOK at the building. Perhaps, then, she could resign herself to waiting patiently for ten o'clock. South Audley Mansions looked exactly the same as usual. What Tuppence had expected she hardly knew, but the sight of its red brick stolidity slightly assuaged the growing and entirely unreasonable uneasiness that possessed her. She was just turning away when she heard a piercing whistle, and the faithful Albert came running from the building to join her. Tuppence frowned. It was no part of the programme to have attention called to her presence in the neighbourhood, but Albert was purple with suppressed excitement. ""I say, miss, she's a-going!"" ""Who's going?"" demanded Tuppence sharply. ""The crook. Ready Rita. Mrs. Vandemeyer. She's a-packing up, and she's just sent down word for me to get her a taxi."" ""What?"" Tuppence clutched his arm. ""It's the truth, miss. I thought maybe as you didn't know about it."" ""Albert,"" cried Tuppence, ""you're a brick. If it hadn't been for you we'd have lost her."" Albert flushed with pleasure at this tribute. ""There's no time to lose,"" said Tuppence, crossing the road. ""I've got to stop her. At all costs I must keep her here until----"" She broke off. ""Albert, there's a telephone here, isn't there?"" The boy shook his head.

""I\'ll try,"" said Wyllard with a certain hesitation; and Mrs. Hastings turned to her companion as they drove away. ""Why did he look at you before he answered me?"" she asked, and laughed, for there was just light enough left to show the colour in Agatha\'s cheek. ""Well,"" she added, ""I told Allen he was sure to be the first."" Agatha looked at her in evident bewilderment, but she nodded. ""Yes,"" she said, ""of course, I knew it would come. Everybody knows by now that you have fallen out with Gregory."" ""But, as I told you, I haven\'t fallen out with him."" ""Then you certainly haven\'t married him, and if you have said \'No\' to Harry Wyllard because you would sooner take Gregory after all, you\'re a singularly unwise young woman. Anyway, you\'ll have to meet him when he comes to supper. Allen\'s fond of a talk with Harry; I can\'t have him kept away."" ""I was a little afraid of that,"" said Agatha quietly. ""What makes the situation more difficult is that he told me he would ask me again."" Mrs. Hastings appeared thoughtful. ""In that case he will in all probability do it; but I don\'t think you need feel diffident about meeting him, especially as you can\'t help it. He\'ll wait and say nothing until he considers it advisable.""

""Why did you do it?"" ""I thought you might save Gregory, if I told you."" ""That was all?"" Sally looked at her with incredulous eyes. ""No,"" answered Agatha simply, ""that was only part. It did not seem right that Gregory should go against Wyllard\'s wishes, and gamble the Range away on the wheat market."" She admitted it without hesitation, for she realized now exactly what had animated her to seek this painful interview. She was fighting Wyllard\'s battle, and that fact sustained her. Sally winced. ""Yes"" she agreed, ""I guess you had to tell me. He was fond of you. One could be proud of that. Harry Wyllard never did anything low down and mean."" Agatha did not resent her candor. Although this was a thing she would scarcely have credited a little while ago, she saw that the girl felt the contrast between Gregory\'s character and that of the man whose place he had taken, and regretted it. Agatha\'s eyes became dim with unshed tears. ""Wyllard, they think, is dead,"" she said, in a low voice. ""You have Gregory still."" Sally looked at her with unveiled compassion, and Agatha did not shrink from', 'be proud of that. Harry Wyllard never did anything low down and mean."" Agatha did not resent her candour. Although this was a thing she would scarcely have credited a little while ago, she saw that the girl felt the contrast between her lover\'s character and that of the man whose place he had taken, and regretted it. Then Agatha\'s eyes grew a trifle hazy. ""Wyllard, they think, is dead,"" she said, in a low, strained voice. ""You have Gregory still."" Sally looked at her with unveiled compassion, and Agatha did not shrink from it. ""Yes,"" she said, with a simplicity that became her, ""and Gregory must have someone to--take care of him. I must do it if I can."" There was no doubt that Agatha was stirred. This half-taught girl\'s quiet acceptance of the burden that many women must carry once more made her almost ashamed. ""We will leave it to you,"" she said. Then it became evident that there was another side to Sally\'s character, for her manner changed, and the suggestive hardness crept back into her eyes. ""Well,"" she said, ""I\'d most been expecting something of this kind when I heard that man Edmonds was going to the Range. He has got a pull on Gregory, but he\'s surely not going to feel quite happy when I get hold of him.""

Drawing a long breath, Tuppence entered the Mansions and ran up to the door of No. 20. How she was to detain Mrs. Vandemeyer until the two men arrived, she did not know, but somehow or other it had to be done, and she must accomplish the task single-handed. What had occasioned this precipitate departure? Did Mrs. Vandemeyer suspect her? Speculations were idle. Tuppence pressed the bell firmly. She might learn something from the cook.

A little thrill passed through him. Her delicately-curved lips were quivering as though with amusement, and her eyes had fallen; she had blushed slightly at that unwitting, ardent look of his. Mr. Sabin\'s cold voice recalled him to himself. ""I believe,"" he said, ""that I overheard your name correctly. It is Wolfenden, is it not?"" Wolfenden assented. ""I am sorry that I haven\'t a card,"" he said. ""That is my name."" Mr. Sabin looked at him curiously. ""Wolfenden is, I believe, the family name of the Deringhams?

Of course I introduced myself to the French doctor as we came along together, for we fortunately got hold of a trap directly, so that no time was lost. The black boy who brought the message told me that you and a young lady had been bitten by a great hound belonging to his master, and that you had killed it. Now, my lad, I am going to cut off your coat and look at your wounds. The Frenchman is attending to the young lady."" ""Mind how you touch my arm, doctor! it is broken somewhere between the elbow and the wrist; I heard it snap when the brute seized me. It threw me down, and I put my arm across over my throat, so as to prevent it from getting at', 'purse and cut a dash;\' eh, doctor? Not that I want to cut a dash. No, I\'m going on the quiet line altogether now: I\'ve done with all that sort of thing."" ""I\'m heartily glad of it; heartily,"" said the doctor. ""Yes, I\'m not going to make way for my far-away cousin yet; not if I know it, at least. I shall soon be all right now, doctor; shan\'t I?"" ""\'All right\' is a long word, Sir Louis. But I do hope you will be all right in time, if you will live with decent prudence. You shouldn\'t take that filth in the morning though."" ""Filth in the morning! That\'s my mother, I suppose! That\'s her ladyship! She\'s been talking, has she? Don\'t you believe her, doctor. There\'s not a young man in Barsetshire is going more regular, all right within the posts, than I am."" The doctor was obliged to acknowledge that there did seem to be some improvement. ""And now, doctor, how about money? Eh?"" Doctor Thorne, like other guardians similarly circumstanced, began to explain that Sir Louis had already had a good deal of money, and had begun also to promise that more should be forthcoming in the event of good behaviour, when he was somewhat suddenly interrupted by Sir Louis. ""Well, now; I\'ll tell you what, doctor; I\'ve got a bit of news for you; something that I think will astonish you."" The doctor opened his eyes, and tried to look as though ready to be', 'a bad pain."" ""Where is it?"" ""Here."" ""Stand up,"" says the doctor, ""and put your arms up above your head."" Then the doctor goes behind the patient and strikes him a powerful blow in the back. ""Do you feel that,"" he says. ""I do,"" says the patient. Then the doctor turns suddenly and lets him have a left hook under the heart. ""Can you feel that,"" he says viciously, as the patient falls over on the sofa in a heap. ""Get up,"" says the doctor, and counts ten. The patient rises. The doctor looks him over very carefully without speaking, and then suddenly fetches him a blow in the stomach that doubles him up speechless. The doctor walks over to the window and reads the morning paper for a while. Presently he turns and begins to mutter more to himself than the patient. ""Hum!"" he says, ""there\'s a slight anaesthesia of the tympanum."" ""Is that so?"" says the patient, in an agony of fear. ""What can I do about it, doctor?"" ""Well,"" says the doctor, ""I want you to keep very quiet; you\'ll have to go to bed and stay there and keep quiet."" In reality, of course, the doctor hasn\'t the least idea what is wrong with the man; but he DOES know that if he will go to bed and keep quiet, awfully quiet, he\'ll either get quietly well again or else die a quiet death.

All these reflections passed through her mind in a flash, and she saw where a chance, a very problematical chance, lay, and she determined to risk all in one supreme effort. Accordingly, she lurched suddenly off the bed and fell on her knees before Mrs. Vandemeyer, clutching her skirts frantically. ""I don't believe it,"" she moaned. ""It's poison--I know it's poison. Oh, don't make me drink it""--her voice rose to a shriek--""don't make me drink it!"" Mrs. Vandemeyer, glass in hand, looked down with a curling lip at this sudden collapse. ""Get up, you little idiot! Don't go on drivelling there. How you ever had the nerve to play your part as you did I can't think."" She stamped her foot. ""Get up, I say."" But Tuppence continued to cling and sob, interjecting her sobs with incoherent appeals for mercy. Every minute gained was to the good. Moreover, as she grovelled, she moved imperceptibly nearer to her objective. Mrs. Vandemeyer gave a sharp impatient exclamation, and jerked the girl to her knees. ""Drink it at once!"" Imperiously she pressed the glass to the girl's lips. Tuppence gave one last despairing moan. ""You swear it won't hurt me?"" she temporized. ""Of course it won't hurt you. Don't be a fool."" ""Will you swear it?"" ""Yes, yes,"" said the other impatiently. ""I swear it."" Tuppence raised a trembling left hand to the glass.

""It is nothing,"" Tommy insisted, a little fiercely. ""He says so,"" Grizel explained, ""not to alarm us. But he is suffering horribly. Just before I called to you his face was all drawn up in pain."" This made the sufferer wince. ""That was another twinge,"" she said promptly. ""What is to be done, Elspeth?"" ""I think I could carry him,"" suggested Corp, with a forward movement that made Tommy stamp his foot--the wooden one. ""I am all right,"" he told them testily, and looking uneasily at Grizel. ""How brave of you to say so!"" said she. ""It is just like him,"" Elspeth said, pleased with Grizel\'s remark. ""I am sure it is,"" Grizel said, so graciously. It was very naughty of her. Had she given him a chance he would have explained that it was all a mistake of Grizel\'s. That had been his intention; but now a devil entered into Tommy and spoke for him. ""I must have slipped and sprained my ankle,"" he said. ""It is slightly painful; but I shall be able to walk home all right, Corp, if you let me use you as a staff."" I think he was a little surprised to hear himself saying this; but, as soon as it was said, he liked it. He was Captain Stroke playing in the Den again, after all, and playing as well as ever. Nothing being so real to Tommy as pretence, I daresay he even began to feel his ankle hurting', 'have endured more stoically though there had been nothing the matter with it."" ""It was soon over,"" Tommy replied lightly. ""I think Elspeth suffered more than I."" Elspeth told the story of his heroism. ""I could not stay in the room,"" she said; ""it was too terrible."" And Grizel despised too tender-hearted Elspeth for that; she was so courageous at facing pain herself. But Tommy had guessed that Elspeth was trembling behind the door, and he had called out, ""Don\'t cry, Elspeth; I am all right; it is nothing at all."" ""How noble!"" was Grizel\'s comment, when she heard of this; and then Elspeth was her friend again, insisted on her staying to tea, and went into the kitchen to prepare it. Aaron was out. The two were alone now, and in the circumstances some men would have given the lady the opportunity to apologize, if such was her desire. But Tommy\'s was a more generous nature; his manner was that of one less sorry to be misjudged than anxious that Grizel should not suffer too much from remorse. If she had asked his pardon then and there, I am sure he would have replied, ""Right willingly, Grizel,"" and begged her not to give another thought to the matter. What is of more importance, Grizel was sure of this also, and it was the magnanimity of him that especially annoyed her. There seemed to be no disturbing it. Even when she said, ""Which foot is it?"" he answered, ""The one', 'shake Corp by the hand again."" ""And Aaron,"" said Elspeth. She was knitting stockings for Aaron at that moment. ""And Gavinia,"" Tommy said, ""and the Dominie."" ""And Ailie."" And then came an awkward pause, for they were both thinking of that independent girl called Grizel. She was seldom discussed. Tommy was oddly shy about mentioning her name; he would have preferred Elspeth to mention it: and Elspeth had misgivings that this was so, with the result that neither could say ""Grizel"" without wondering what was in the other\'s mind. Tommy had written twice to Grizel, the first time unknown to Elspeth, but that was in the days when the ladies of the penny numbers were disturbing him, and, against his better judgment (for well he knew she would never stand it), he had begun his letter with these mad words: ""Dear Little Woman."" She did not answer this, but soon afterwards she wrote to Elspeth, and he was not mentioned in the letter proper, but it carried a sting in its tail. ""P.S.,"" it said ""How is Sentimental Tommy?"" None but a fiend in human shape could have written thus, and Elspeth put her protecting arms round her brother. ""Now we know what Grizel is,"" she said. ""I am done with her now."" But when Tommy had got back his wind he said nobly: ""I\'ll call her no names. If this is how she likes to repay me for--for all my kindnesses, let her.

Then, quick as a flash, Tuppence jerked the glass upward as hard as she could. The fluid in it splashed into Mrs. Vandemeyer's face, and during her momentary gasp, Tuppence's right hand shot out and grasped the revolver where it lay on the edge of the washstand. The next moment she had sprung back a pace, and the revolver pointed straight at Mrs. Vandemeyer's heart, with no unsteadiness in the hand that held it. In the moment of victory, Tuppence betrayed a somewhat unsportsmanlike triumph. ""Now who's on top and who's underneath?"" she crowed. The other's face was convulsed with rage. For a minute Tuppence thought she was going to spring upon her, which would have placed the girl in an unpleasant dilemma, since she meant to draw the line at actually letting off the revolver. However, with an effort Mrs. Vandemeyer controlled herself, and at last a slow evil smile crept over her face. ""Not a fool, then, after all! You did that well, girl. But you shall pay for it--oh, yes, you shall pay for it! I have a long memory!"" ""I'm surprised you should have been gulfed so easily,"" said Tuppence scornfully.

""I don\'t remember mentioning his name at all,"" Wolfenden said, vaguely disturbed. Mr. Sabin addressed his ball with care and played it deliberately on to the green. Then he returned to the subject. ""I think that you must have done,"" he said suavely, ""or I should scarcely have known it. Was he in the room?"" ""All the time,"" Wolfenden answered. Mr. Sabin drew another little breath. ""He was there when the fellow bolted?"" Wolfenden nodded. ""Why did he not try to stop him?"" Wolfenden smiled. ""Physically,"" he remarked, ""it would have been an impossibility. Blatherwick is a small man and an exceedingly nervous one. He is an honest little fellow, but I am afraid he would not have shone in an encounter of that sort."" Mr. Sabin was on the point of asking another question, but Wolfenden interrupted him. He scarcely knew why, but he wanted to get away from the subject. He was sorry that he had ever broached it. ""Come,"" he said, ""we are talking too much. Let us play golf. I am sure I put you off that last stroke."" Mr. Sabin took the hint and was silent. They were on the eleventh green, and bordering it on the far side was an open road--the sea', 'said dryly, ""nothing whatever the matter with him, except that he is mad."" ""On the whole, I cannot say that I am surprised to hear it,"" Wolfenden remarked; ""but I certainly think that, considering the form his madness takes, you ought to protect yourself in some way."" Mr. Sabin shrugged his shoulders contemptuously. ""He can never hurt me. I carry a talisman which is proof against any attempt that he can make; but none the less, I must confess that your aid last night was very welcome."" ""I was very pleased to be of any service,"" Wolfenden said, ""especially,"" he added, glancing toward Mr. Sabin\'s niece, ""since it has given me the pleasure of your acquaintance."" A little thrill passed through him. Her delicately-curved lips were quivering as though with amusement, and her eyes had fallen; she had blushed slightly at that unwitting, ardent look of his. Mr. Sabin\'s cold voice recalled him to himself. ""I believe,"" he said, ""that I overheard your name correctly. It is Wolfenden, is it not?"" Wolfenden assented. ""I am sorry that I haven\'t a card,"" he said. ""That is my name."" Mr. Sabin looked at him curiously. ""Wolfenden is, I believe, the family name of the Deringhams? May I ask, are you any relation to Admiral Lord Deringham?"" Wolfenden was suddenly grave. ""Yes,"" he answered; ""he is my father. Did you ever meet him?"" Mr. Sabin shook his head. ""No, I have heard of him abroad; also, I believe, of the Countess of Deringham,', 'your aid last night. I was anxious to get away before any fuss was made, or I would have expressed my gratitude at the time in a more seemly fashion.""

Before Mr. Pickwick could reply, before Mr. Perker had taken one twentieth part of the snuff with which so unusually long an address imperatively required to be followed up, there was a low murmuring of voices outside, and then a hesitating knock at the door. 'Dear, dear,' exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, who had been evidently roused by his friend's appeal; 'what an annoyance that door is! Who is that?' 'Me, Sir,' replied Sam Weller, putting in his head. 'I can't speak to you just now, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'I am engaged at this moment, Sam.' 'Beg your pardon, Sir,' rejoined Mr. Weller. 'But here's a lady here, Sir, as says she's somethin' wery partickler to disclose.' 'I can't see any lady,' replied Mr. Pickwick, whose mind was filled with visions of Mrs. Bardell. 'I wouldn't make too sure o' that, Sir,' urged Mr. Weller, shaking his head. 'If you know'd who was near, sir, I rayther think you'd change your note; as the hawk remarked to himself vith a cheerful laugh, ven he heerd the robin-redbreast a-singin' round the corner.' 'Who is it?' inquired Mr. Pickwick. 'Will you see her, Sir?' asked Mr. Weller, holding the door in his hand as if he had some curious live animal on the other side. 'I suppose I must,' said Mr. Pickwick, looking at Perker. 'Well then, all in to begin!' cried Sam. 'Sound the gong, draw up"", ""Mr. Pickwick, with great severity, 'hold your tongue.' 'Wery well, sir,' replied Mr. Weller. 'I don't like this plan,' said Mr. Pickwick, after deep meditation. 'Why cannot I communicate with the young lady's friends?' 'Because they live one hundred miles from here, sir,' responded Job Trotter. 'That's a clincher,' said Mr. Weller, aside. 'Then this garden,' resumed Mr. Pickwick. 'How am I to get into it?' 'The wall is very low, sir, and your servant will give you a leg up.' 'My servant will give me a leg up,' repeated Mr. Pickwick mechanically. 'You will be sure to be near this door that you speak of?' 'You cannot mistake it, Sir; it's the only one that opens into the garden. Tap at it when you hear the clock strike, and I will open it instantly.' 'I don't like the plan,' said Mr. Pickwick; 'but as I see no other, and as the happiness of this young lady's whole life is at stake, I adopt it. I shall be sure to be there.' Thus, for the second time, did Mr. Pickwick's innate good-feeling involve him in an enterprise from which he would most willingly have stood aloof. 'What is the name of the house?' inquired Mr. Pickwick. 'Westgate House, Sir. You turn a little to the right when you get to the end of the town; it stands by itself, some little distance off the high road, with the name on a brass plate on the gate.'

Agatha Christie___The Secret Adversary.txt,"Tuppence looked round to see what had startled her. In the doorway were Sir James Peel Edgerton and Julius Hersheimmer. CHAPTER XIII. THE VIGIL SIR James brushed past Julius and hurriedly bent over the fallen woman. ""Heart,"" he said sharply. ""Seeing us so suddenly must have given her a shock. Brandy--and quickly, or she'll slip through our fingers."" Julius hurried to the washstand. ""Not there,"" said Tuppence over her shoulder. ""In the tantalus in the dining-room. Second door down the passage."" Between them Sir James and Tuppence lifted Mrs. Vandemeyer and carried her to the bed. There they dashed water on her face, but with no result. The lawyer fingered her pulse. ""Touch and go,"" he muttered. ""I wish that young fellow would hurry up with the brandy."" At that moment Julius re-entered the room, carrying a glass half full of the spirit which he handed to Sir James. While Tuppence lifted her head the lawyer tried to force a little of the spirit between her closed lips. Finally the woman opened her eyes feebly. Tuppence held the glass to her lips. ""Drink this."" Mrs. Vandemeyer complied. The brandy brought the colour back to her white cheeks, and revived her in a marvellous fashion. She tried to sit up--then fell back with a groan, her hand to her side. ""It's my heart,"" she whispered. ""I mustn't talk."" She lay back with closed eyes.

Blanche looked round at the sleeping Geoffrey. ""And _he_ knows!"" she said. ""It\'s maddening, uncle, to look at the brute snoring in his chair!"" Sir Patrick held up a warning hand. Before a word more could be said between them they were silenced again by another interruption. The whist-party comprised Lady Lundie and the surgeon, playing as partners against Smith and Jones. Arnold sat behind the surgeon, taking a lesson in the game. One, Two, and Three, thus left to their own devices, naturally thought of the billiard-table; and, detecting Geoffrey asleep in his corner, advanced to disturb his slumbers, under the all-sufficing apology of ""Pool."" Geoffrey roused himself, and rubbed his eyes, and said, drowsily, ""All right."" As he rose, he looked at the opposite corner in which Sir Patrick and his niece were sitting. Blanche\'s self-possession, resolutely as she struggled to preserve it, was not strong enough to keep her eyes from turning toward Geoffrey with an expression which betrayed the reluctant interest that she now felt in him. He stopped, noticing something entirely new in the look with which the young lady was regarding him. ""Beg your pardon,"" said Geoffrey. ""Do you wish to speak to me?"" Blanche\'s face flushed all over. Her uncle came to the rescue. ""Miss Lundie and I hope you have slept well Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick, jocosely. ""That\'s all."" ""Oh? That\'s all?"" said Geoffrey still', 'looked like himself again. ""Why go indoors this lovely weather?"" he said. ""Suppose we take a turn in the garden?"" Blanche pressed Anne\'s hand significantly. The proposal was evidently made for a purpose. They turned the corner of the cottage and gained the large garden at the back--the two ladies walking together, arm in arm; Sir Patrick and Geoffrey following them. Little by little, Blanche quickened her pace. ""I have got my instructions,"" she whispered to Anne. ""Let\'s get out of his hearing."" It was more easily said than done. Geoffrey kept close behind them. ""Consider my lameness, Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick. ""Not quite so fast."" It was well intended. But Geoffrey\'s cunning had taken the alarm. Instead of dropping behind with Sir Patrick, he called to his wife. ""Consider Sir Patrick\'s lameness,"" he repeated. ""Not quite so fast."" Sir Patrick met that check with characteristic readiness. When Anne slackened her pace, he addressed himself to Geoffrey, stopping deliberately in the middle of the path. ""Let me give you my message from Holchester House,"" he said. The two ladies were still slowly walking on. Geoffrey was placed between the alternatives of staying with Sir Patrick and leaving them by themselves--or of following them and leaving Sir Patrick. Deliberately, on his side, he followed the ladies. Sir Patrick called him back. ""I told you I wished to speak to you,"" he said, sharply. Driven to bay, Geoffrey openly revealed his resolution to give Blanche no opportunity of speaking in private', 'look at Anne. The look was not returned--was not even seen. From the moment when she had taken her place by Sir Patrick, Anne\'s eyes had rested on Blanche. They never moved--they never for an instant lost their tender sadness--when the woman who hated her spoke. All that was beautiful and true in that noble nature seemed to find its one sufficient encouragement in Blanche. As she looked once more at the sister of the unforgotten days of old, its native beauty of expression shone out again in her worn and weary face. Every man in the room (but Geoffrey) looked at her; and every man (but Geoffrey) felt for her. Sir Patrick addressed a second question to his sister-in-law. ""Is there any one here to represent the interests of Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn?"" he asked. Lady Lundie referred Sir Patrick to Geoffrey himself. Without looking up, Geoffrey motioned with his big brown hand to Mr. Moy, sitting by his side. Mr. Moy (holding the legal rank in Scotland which corresponds to the rank held by solicitors in England) rose and bowed to Sir Patrick, with the courtesy due to a man eminent in his time at the Scottish Bar. ""I represent Mr. Delamayn,"" he said. ""I congratulate myself, Sir Patrick, on having your ability and experience to appeal to in the conduct of the pending inquiry."" Sir Patrick returned the compliment as well as the bow. ""It is I who should learn from you,"" he answered.

Clearly any scheme for cross-questioning the lady was out of the question for the moment. For the time being they were baffled, and could do nothing. Tuppence related how Mrs. Vandemeyer had declared herself willing to disclose the identity of Mr. Brown, and how she had consented to discover and reveal to them the whereabouts of Jane Finn. Julius was congratulatory. ""That's all right, Miss Tuppence. Splendid! I guess that hundred thousand pounds will look just as good in the morning to the lady as it did over night. There's nothing to worry over. She won't speak without the cash anyway, you bet!"" There was certainly a good deal of common sense in this, and Tuppence felt a little comforted.

Still, it cannot be helped, it is only a matter of waiting until the morning."" He looked across at the inert figure on the bed. Mrs. Vandemeyer lay perfectly passive with closed eyes.

""Well,"" she added, ""I told Allen he was sure to be the first."" Agatha looked at her in evident bewilderment, but she nodded. ""Yes,"" she said, ""of course, I knew it would come.

""Why did you do it?"" ""I thought you might save Gregory, if I told you."" ""That was all?"" Sally looked at her with incredulous eyes. ""No,"" answered Agatha simply, ""that was only part. It did not seem right that Gregory should go against Wyllard\'s wishes, and gamble the Range away on the wheat market."" She admitted it without hesitation, for she realized now exactly what had animated her to seek this painful interview. She was fighting Wyllard\'s battle, and that fact sustained her. Sally winced. ""Yes"" she agreed, ""I guess you had to tell me. He was fond of you. One could be proud of that. Harry Wyllard never did anything low down and mean."" Agatha did not resent her candor. Although this was a thing she would scarcely have credited a little while ago, she saw that the girl felt the contrast between Gregory\'s character and that of the man whose place he had taken, and regretted it. Agatha\'s eyes became dim with unshed tears. ""Wyllard, they think, is dead,"" she said, in a low voice. ""You have Gregory still.""

Then Agatha\'s eyes grew a trifle hazy. ""Wyllard, they think, is dead,"" she said, in a low, strained voice. ""You have Gregory still."" Sally looked at her with unveiled compassion, and Agatha did not shrink from it. ""Yes,"" she said, with a simplicity that became her, ""and Gregory must have someone to--take care of him. I must do it if I can."" There was no doubt that Agatha was stirred. This half-taught girl\'s quiet acceptance of the burden that many women must carry once more made her almost ashamed. ""We will leave it to you,"" she said. Then it became evident that there was another side to Sally\'s character, for her manner changed, and the suggestive hardness crept back into her eyes. ""Well,"" she said, ""I\'d most been expecting something of this kind when I heard that man Edmonds was going to the Range.

LADY JANET\'S LETTER. THE narrative leaves Lady Janet and Horace Holmcroft together, and returns to Julian and Mercy in the library. An interval passed--a long interval, measured by the impatient reckoning of suspense--after the cab which had taken Grace Roseberry away had left the house. The minutes followed each other; and still the warning sound of Horace\'s footsteps was not heard on the marble pavement of the hall. By common (though unexpressed) consent, Julian and Mercy avoided touching upon the one subject on which they were now both interested alike. With their thoughts fixed secretly in vain speculation on the nature of the interview which was then taking place in Lady Janet\'s room, they tried to speak on topics indifferent to both of them--tried, and failed, and tried again. In a last and longest pause of silence between them, the next event happened. The door from the hall was softly and suddenly opened. Was it', 'Janet, before you turn your back on me,"" she said, firmly. ""One word, and I will be content. Has Colonel Roseberry\'s letter found its way to this house or not? If it has, did a woman bring it to you?"" Lady Janet looked--as only a great lady can look, when a person of inferior rank has presumed to fail in respect toward her. ""You are surely not aware,"" she said, with icy composure, ""that these questions are an insult to Me?"" ""And worse than an insult,"" Horace added, warmly, ""to Grace!"" The little resolute black figure (still barring the way to the conservatory) was suddenly shaken from head to foot. The woman\'s eyes traveled backward and forward between Lady Janet and Horace with the light of a new suspicion in them. ""Grace!"" she exclaimed. ""What Grace? That\'s my name. Lady Janet, you _have_ got the letter! The woman is here!"" Lady Janet dropped Horace\'s arm, and retraced her steps to the place at which her nephew was standing. ""Julian,"" she said. ""You force me, for the first time in my life, to remind you of the respect that is due to me in my own house. Send that woman away."" Without waiting to be answered, she turned back again, and once more took Horace\'s arm. ""Stand back, if you please,"" she said, quietly, to Grace. Grace held her ground.

The discovery that she had made on opening the drawing-room door still hung on her mind. Julian had certainly convinced her that she had misinterpreted what she had seen; but he had convinced her against her will. She had found Mercy deeply agitated; suspiciously silent. Julian might be innocent, she admitted--there was no accounting for the vagaries of men. But the case of Mercy was altogether different. Women did not find themselves in the arms of men without knowing what they were about. Acquitting Julian, Lady Janet declined to acquit Mercy. ""There is some secret understanding between them,"" thought the old lady, ""and she\'s to blame; the women always are!"" Mercy still waited to be spoken to; pale and quiet, silent and submissive.

You heard what the man said to Julian--I saw you listening. Are you horribly frightened?"" ""No, Lady Janet."" ""Not even nervous?"" ""No, Lady Janet."" ""Ha!

With a feeling of perfect security, he complacently regarded his handiwork, and then, sitting on the edge of the bed, began to undress. He turned the lamp down a little, and reloading the empty chambers of his revolver, placed it by the side of the lamp on the drawers. Then, as he turned back the clothes, he fancied that something moved beneath them. As he paused, it dropped lightly from the other side of the bed to the floor. At first he sat, with knitted brows, trying to see what it was. He had only had a glimpse of it, but he certainly had an idea that it was alive. A rat perhaps. He got off the bed again with an oath, and, taking the lamp in his hand, peered cautiously about the floor. Twice he walked round the room in this fashion. Then he stooped down, and, raising the dirty bed hangings, peered beneath.

""Yes, it does,"" admitted Tuppence. ""But, anyway, here goes. Perhaps you'd both come, too, in case she springs on me, or anything. You see, we don't know what mood she'll wake up in.""

She heaved a sigh of relief as she saw that Mrs. Vandemeyer was lying on the bed. ""Good morning,"" she remarked cheerfully. ""I've brought you some tea."" Mrs. Vandemeyer did not reply. Tuppence put down the cup on the table by the bed and went across to draw up the blinds. When she turned, Mrs. Vandemeyer still lay without a movement. With a sudden fear clutching at her heart, Tuppence ran to the bed. The hand she lifted was cold as ice.... Mrs. Vandemeyer would never speak now.... Her cry brought the others.

Blanche looked round at the sleeping Geoffrey. ""And _he_ knows!"" she said. ""It\'s maddening, uncle, to look at the brute snoring in his chair!"" Sir Patrick held up a warning hand. Before a word more could be said between them they were silenced again by another interruption. The whist-party comprised Lady Lundie and the surgeon, playing as partners against Smith and Jones. Arnold sat behind the surgeon, taking a lesson in the game. One, Two, and Three, thus left to their own devices, naturally thought of the billiard-table; and, detecting Geoffrey asleep in his corner, advanced to disturb his slumbers, under the all-sufficing apology of ""Pool."" Geoffrey roused himself, and rubbed his eyes, and said, drowsily, ""All right."" As he rose, he looked at the opposite corner in which Sir Patrick and his niece were sitting. Blanche\'s self-possession, resolutely as she struggled to preserve it, was not strong enough to keep her eyes from turning toward Geoffrey with an expression which betrayed the reluctant interest that she now felt in him. He stopped, noticing something entirely new in the look with which the young lady was regarding him. ""Beg your pardon,"" said Geoffrey. ""Do you wish to speak to me?"" Blanche\'s face flushed all over. Her uncle came to the rescue. ""Miss Lundie and I hope you have slept well Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick, jocosely. ""That\'s all."" ""Oh? That\'s all?"" said Geoffrey still', 'looked like himself again. ""Why go indoors this lovely weather?"" he said. ""Suppose we take a turn in the garden?"" Blanche pressed Anne\'s hand significantly. The proposal was evidently made for a purpose. They turned the corner of the cottage and gained the large garden at the back--the two ladies walking together, arm in arm; Sir Patrick and Geoffrey following them. Little by little, Blanche quickened her pace. ""I have got my instructions,"" she whispered to Anne. ""Let\'s get out of his hearing."" It was more easily said than done. Geoffrey kept close behind them. ""Consider my lameness, Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick. ""Not quite so fast."" It was well intended. But Geoffrey\'s cunning had taken the alarm. Instead of dropping behind with Sir Patrick, he called to his wife. ""Consider Sir Patrick\'s lameness,"" he repeated. ""Not quite so fast."" Sir Patrick met that check with characteristic readiness. When Anne slackened her pace, he addressed himself to Geoffrey, stopping deliberately in the middle of the path. ""Let me give you my message from Holchester House,"" he said. The two ladies were still slowly walking on. Geoffrey was placed between the alternatives of staying with Sir Patrick and leaving them by themselves--or of following them and leaving Sir Patrick. Deliberately, on his side, he followed the ladies. Sir Patrick called him back. ""I told you I wished to speak to you,"" he said, sharply. Driven to bay, Geoffrey openly revealed his resolution to give Blanche no opportunity of speaking in private', 'look at Anne. The look was not returned--was not even seen. From the moment when she had taken her place by Sir Patrick, Anne\'s eyes had rested on Blanche. They never moved--they never for an instant lost their tender sadness--when the woman who hated her spoke. All that was beautiful and true in that noble nature seemed to find its one sufficient encouragement in Blanche. As she looked once more at the sister of the unforgotten days of old, its native beauty of expression shone out again in her worn and weary face. Every man in the room (but Geoffrey) looked at her; and every man (but Geoffrey) felt for her. Sir Patrick addressed a second question to his sister-in-law. ""Is there any one here to represent the interests of Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn?"" he asked. Lady Lundie referred Sir Patrick to Geoffrey himself. Without looking up, Geoffrey motioned with his big brown hand to Mr. Moy, sitting by his side. Mr. Moy (holding the legal rank in Scotland which corresponds to the rank held by solicitors in England) rose and bowed to Sir Patrick, with the courtesy due to a man eminent in his time at the Scottish Bar. ""I represent Mr. Delamayn,"" he said. ""I congratulate myself, Sir Patrick, on having your ability and experience to appeal to in the conduct of the pending inquiry."" Sir Patrick returned the compliment as well as the bow. ""It is I who should learn from you,"" he answered.

The lawyer was calmer, but there was a curious gleam in his eyes. ""If it is luck,"" he replied. ""You don't think--but, say, that's plumb impossible--no one could have got in."" ""No,"" admitted the lawyer. ""I don't see how they could. And yet--she is on the point of betraying Mr. Brown, and--she dies. Is it only chance?"" ""But how----"" ""Yes, HOW! That is what we must find out."" He stood there silently, gently stroking his chin. ""We must find out,"" he said quietly, and Tuppence felt that if she was Mr. Brown she would not like the tone of those simple words. Julius's glance went to the window. ""The window's open,"" he remarked. ""Do you think----"" Tuppence shook her head. ""The balcony only goes along as far as the boudoir. We were there."" ""He might have slipped out----"" suggested Julius. But Sir James interrupted him. ""Mr. Brown's methods are not so crude. In the meantime we must send for a doctor, but before we do so, is there anything in this room that might be of value to us?"" Hastily, the three searched. A charred mass in the grate indicated that Mrs. Vandemeyer had been burning papers on the eve of her flight. Nothing of importance remained, though they searched the other rooms as well.

""Well,"" she added, ""I told Allen he was sure to be the first."" Agatha looked at her in evident bewilderment, but she nodded. ""Yes,"" she said, ""of course, I knew it would come. Everybody knows by now that you have fallen out with Gregory."" ""But, as I told you, I haven\'t fallen out with him."" ""Then you certainly haven\'t married him, and if you have said \'No\' to Harry Wyllard because you would sooner take Gregory after all, you\'re a singularly unwise young woman. Anyway, you\'ll have to meet him when he comes to supper. Allen\'s fond of a talk with Harry; I can\'t have him kept away."" ""I was a little afraid of that,"" said Agatha quietly. ""What makes the situation more difficult is that he told me he would ask me again."" Mrs. Hastings appeared thoughtful.

""Why did you do it?"" ""I thought you might save Gregory, if I told you."" ""That was all?"" Sally looked at her with incredulous eyes. ""No,"" answered Agatha simply, ""that was only part. It did not seem right that Gregory should go against Wyllard\'s wishes, and gamble the Range away on the wheat market."" She admitted it without hesitation, for she realized now exactly what had animated her to seek this painful interview. She was fighting Wyllard\'s battle, and that fact sustained her. Sally winced. ""Yes"" she agreed, ""I guess you had to tell me. He was fond of you. One could be proud of that. Harry Wyllard never did anything low down and mean."" Agatha did not resent her candor. Although this was a thing she would scarcely have credited a little while ago, she saw that the girl felt the contrast between Gregory\'s character and that of the man whose place he had taken, and regretted it. Agatha\'s eyes became dim with unshed tears. ""Wyllard, they think, is dead,"" she said, in a low voice. ""You have Gregory still."" Sally looked at her with unveiled compassion, and Agatha did not shrink from', 'be proud of that. Harry Wyllard never did anything low down and mean."" Agatha did not resent her candour.

Sally looked at her with unveiled compassion, and Agatha did not shrink from it. ""Yes,"" she said, with a simplicity that became her, ""and Gregory must have someone to--take care of him.

""We will leave it to you,"" she said. Then it became evident that there was another side to Sally\'s character, for her manner changed, and the suggestive hardness crept back into her eyes. ""Well,"" she said, ""I\'d most been expecting something of this kind when I heard that man Edmonds was going to the Range.

In five minutes a brisk young doctor arrived, hastily summoned. He was deferential to Sir James, whom he recognized. ""Heart failure, or possibly an overdose of some sleeping-draught."" He sniffed.

The doctor accepted quite readily the theory that Mrs. Vandemeyer had accidentally taken an overdose of chloral. He doubted whether an inquest would be necessary. If so, he would let Sir James know. He understood that Mrs. Vandemeyer was on the eve of departure for abroad, and that the servants had already left?

""Yes, I\'m not going to make way for my far-away cousin yet; not if I know it, at least. I shall soon be all right now, doctor; shan\'t I?"" ""\'All right\' is a long word, Sir Louis. But I do hope you will be all right in time, if you will live with decent prudence. You shouldn\'t take that filth in the morning though."" ""Filth in the morning! That\'s my mother, I suppose! That\'s her ladyship! She\'s been talking, has she? Don\'t you believe her, doctor. There\'s not a young man in Barsetshire is going more regular, all right within the posts, than I am."" The doctor was obliged to acknowledge that there did seem to be some improvement. ""And now, doctor, how about money? Eh?"" Doctor Thorne, like other guardians similarly circumstanced, began to explain that Sir Louis had already had a good deal of money, and had begun also to promise that more should be forthcoming in the event of good behaviour, when he was somewhat suddenly interrupted by Sir Louis. ""Well, now; I\'ll tell you what, doctor; I\'ve got a bit of news for you; something that I think will astonish you."" The doctor opened his eyes, and tried to look as though ready to be', 'a bad pain."" ""Where is it?"" ""Here."" ""Stand up,"" says the doctor, ""and put your arms up above your head."" Then the doctor goes behind the patient and strikes him a powerful blow in the back. ""Do you feel that,"" he says. ""I do,"" says the patient. Then the doctor turns suddenly and lets him have a left hook under the heart. ""Can you feel that,"" he says viciously, as the patient falls over on the sofa in a heap. ""Get up,"" says the doctor, and counts ten. The patient rises. The doctor looks him over very carefully without speaking, and then suddenly fetches him a blow in the stomach that doubles him up speechless. The doctor walks over to the window and reads the morning paper for a while. Presently he turns and begins to mutter more to himself than the patient. ""Hum!"" he says, ""there\'s a slight anaesthesia of the tympanum."" ""Is that so?"" says the patient, in an agony of fear. ""What can I do about it, doctor?"" ""Well,"" says the doctor, ""I want you to keep very quiet; you\'ll have to go to bed and stay there and keep quiet."" In reality, of course, the doctor hasn\'t the least idea what is wrong with the man; but he DOES know that if he will go to bed and keep quiet, awfully quiet, he\'ll either get quietly well again or else die a quiet death.

We're very grateful for all you've told us. I'm afraid we're now in the position of having to track Miss Vandemeyer anew. What about the nurse who accompanied her; I suppose you don't know where she is?"" The doctor shook his head. ""We've not heard from her, as it happens. I understood she was to remain with Miss Vandemeyer for a while. But what can have happened? Surely the girl has not been kidnapped."" ""That remains to be seen,"" said Sir James gravely. The other hesitated. ""You do not think I ought to go to the police?"" ""No, no. In all probability the young lady is with other relations."" The doctor was not completely satisfied, but he saw that Sir James was determined to say no more, and realized that to try and extract more information from the famous K.C. would be mere waste of labour. Accordingly, he wished them goodbye, and they left the hotel. For a few minutes they stood by the car talking. ""How maddening,"" cried Tuppence. ""To think that Julius must have been actually under the same roof with her for a few hours."" ""I was a darned idiot,"" muttered Julius gloomily. ""You couldn't know,"" Tuppence consoled him.

""Nothing?"" said Tuppence blankly. ""And--Tommy?"" ""We must hope for the best,"" said Sir James. ""Oh yes, we must go on hoping."" But over her downcast head his eyes met Julius's, and almost imperceptibly he shook his head. Julius understood. The lawyer considered the case hopeless. The young American's face grew grave.

""Mr. Blatherwick--your father\'s secretary,"" Mr. Sabin repeated coolly; ""I understood you to say that his name was Blatherwick."" ""I don\'t remember mentioning his name at all,"" Wolfenden said, vaguely disturbed. Mr. Sabin addressed his ball with care and played it deliberately on to the green. Then he returned to the subject. ""I think that you must have done,"" he said suavely, ""or I should scarcely have known it. Was he in the room?"" ""All the time,"" Wolfenden answered. Mr. Sabin drew another little breath. ""He was there when the fellow bolted?"" Wolfenden nodded. ""Why did he not try to stop him?"" Wolfenden smiled.

He is an honest little fellow, but I am afraid he would not have shone in an encounter of that sort."" Mr. Sabin was on the point of asking another question, but Wolfenden interrupted him. He scarcely knew why, but he wanted to get away from the subject. He was sorry that he had ever broached it. ""Come,"" he said, ""we are talking too much. Let us play golf.

They were on the eleventh green, and bordering it on the far side was an open road--the sea', 'said dryly, ""nothing whatever the matter with him, except that he is mad."" ""On the whole, I cannot say that I am surprised to hear it,"" Wolfenden remarked; ""but I certainly think that, considering the form his madness takes, you ought to protect yourself in some way.""

A little thrill passed through him. Her delicately-curved lips were quivering as though with amusement, and her eyes had fallen; she had blushed slightly at that unwitting, ardent look of his. Mr. Sabin\'s cold voice recalled him to himself. ""I believe,"" he said, ""that I overheard your name correctly. It is Wolfenden, is it not?"" Wolfenden assented. ""I am sorry that I haven\'t a card,"" he said. ""That is my name."" Mr. Sabin looked at him curiously. ""Wolfenden is, I believe, the family name of the Deringhams? May I ask, are you any relation to Admiral Lord Deringham?"" Wolfenden was suddenly grave. ""Yes,"" he answered; ""he is my father. Did you ever meet him?"" Mr. Sabin shook his head. ""No, I have heard of him abroad; also, I believe, of the Countess of Deringham,', 'your aid last night. I was anxious to get away before any fuss was made, or I would have expressed my gratitude at the time in a more seemly fashion."" ""I hope,"" Wolfenden said, ""that you will not think it necessary to say anything more about it. I did what any one in my place would have done without a moment\'s hesitation.""

There was little in it but the tender assurance Suzette gave him of their love, and the anxiety of Adeline and herself to know how and where he was. She told him that he was not to feel troubled about them; that they were well, and unhappy only for him; but he must not think they blamed him, or had ever done so. As soon as they were sure they could reach him, she said, they would write to him again. Adeline wrote a few lines with her name, to say that for some days past she had not been quite well; but that she was better and had nothing to wish for but to hear from him. When Pinney came back a second time, he found Northwick with the letter open in his hand. ""Well, sir,"" he said, with the easy respectfulness toward Northwick that had been replacing, ever since he talked with Matt Hilary, the hail-fellow manner he used with most men, and that had now fully established itself, ""You\'ve got some noble scenery about here."" He meant to compliment Northwick on the beauty of the landscape, as people ascribe merit to the inhabitants of a flourishing city. Northwick, by his silence, neither accepted nor disclaimed the credit of the local picturesqueness; and Pinney ventured to add, ""But you seem to take it out in nature, Mr. Northwick.

He had not been asked to Hatboro\' to see them before he started, and with all the will he had to invent comfortable and attractive circumstances for them, he was at a disadvantage for want of material. The most that he could conjecture was that Mr. Hilary\'s family had not broken off their friendly relations with them. He had heard old Hilary criticised for it, and he told Northwick so. ""I guess he\'s been standing by you, Mr. Northwick, as far as he consistently could,"" he said; and Northwick ventured to reply that he expected that. ""It was young Hilary who brought me the letter, and talked the whole thing up with me,"" Pinney added. Northwick had apparently not expected this; but he let no more than the fact appear. He kept silent for a time; then he said, ""And you don\'t know anything about the way they\'re living?"" ""No, I don\'t,"" said Pinney, with final candor. ""But I should say they were living along there about as usual. Mr. Hilary didn\'t say but what they were. I guess you haven\'t got any cause to be uneasy on that score.

Hilary felt the peculiar hardships of his position, all the more keenly because he had a conscience that would not permit him to shirk his duty. He had used his influence, the weight of his character and business repute, to control the action of the Board towards Northwick, when the defalcation became known, and now he was doubly bound to respond to the wishes of the directors in proceeding against him. Most of them believed that Northwick was still alive; those who were not sure regarded it as a public duty to have him indicted at any rate, and they all voted that Hilary should make the necessary complaint. Then Hilary had no choice but to obey. Another man in his place might have resigned, but he could not, for he knew that he was finally responsible for Northwick's escape. He made it no less his duty to find out just how much hardship it would work Northwick's daughters, and he tried to lend them money. But Suzette answered for both that her father had left them some money when he went away; and Hilary could only send Louise to explain how he must formally appear in the legal proceedings; he allowed Louise to put whatever warmth of color she wished into his regrets and into his advice that they should consult a lawyer.

""Still, I guess we'll leave it like that."" ""Very well,"" said Tuppence meekly. Neither of them spoke again until they reached the Ritz. Tuppence went upstairs to her room. She felt morally battered to the ground after her conflict with Julius's vigorous personality. Sitting down in front of the glass, she stared at her own reflection for some minutes.

Still Mr. Low shook his head. ""I believe things can always be found out, if only you take trouble enough. And trouble means money;--does it not? We wouldn\'t mind how many thousand pounds it cost; would we, Marie?"" ""I fear that the spending of thousands can do no good,"" said Mr. Low. ""But something must be done. You don\'t mean to say that Mr. Finn is to be hung because Lord Fawn says that he saw a man running along the street in a grey coat."" ""Certainly not.""

""That,"" said Mr. George, ""is equal, with a proper allowance for repairs, to, say a thousand dollars per day. Now, do you think that the people who will come here to see it will get pleasure enough from it to amount in all to a thousand dollars a day?"" ""I don\'t know,"" said Rollo, doubtfully. ""I\'d give one dollar, I know, to see it."" ""Yes,"" said Mr. George, ""so would I; and I do not know but that there would be three hundred thousand to come in a year, including all the great occasions that would bring out immense assemblages from all the surrounding country.""

""And I mean to put a little in the man\'s plate when I go down,"" said Rollo, ""and then I shall have a share in it."" ""I will too,"" said Mr. George. Accordingly, as they passed by the man when they were leaving the church, Mr. George put a franc into his plate, and Rollo half a franc. Just at the time that they put their money in, the party that Minnie belonged to came by, and the gentleman put in a silver coin', 'more prosperous one in the city."" At the close of the week came visitors--Frank, Doc Linyard, and a strange gentleman, who was introduced as Mr. Styles, the old sailor\'s lawyer friend. ""Mr. Styles says your claim is all right,"" said Doc Linyard, when introductions all round were over. ""He says as how you\'ll get twenty-five hundred dollars afore three months are up."" It was glorious news. ""Sure?"" asked Mrs. Dare, with tears in her eyes. ""Positive, madam,"" replied Mr. Styles.

For a moment she struggled for self-control, and then abandoning all presence, she held it to her lips and burst into a fit of sobbing. ""Oh, Tommy, Tommy,"" she cried, ""I do love you so--and I may never see you again...."" At the end of five minutes Tuppence sat up, blew her nose, and pushed back her hair.

I wonder if he did find anything in that safe----"" Tuppence's meditations went off on another tack. She reviewed the events of last night carefully and persistently. Somehow, they seemed bound up with Sir James's enigmatical words.... Suddenly she gave a great start--the colour faded out of her face. Her eyes, fascinated, gazed in front of her, the pupils dilated. ""Impossible,"" she murmured. ""Impossible! I must be going mad even to think of such a thing...."" Monstrous--yet it explained everything.... After a moment's reflection she sat down and wrote a note, weighing each word as she did so. Finally she nodded her head as though satisfied, and slipped it into an envelope which she addressed to Julius. She went down the passage to his sitting-room and knocked at the door. As she had expected, the room was empty. She left the note on the table. A small page-boy was waiting outside her own door when she returned to it. ""Telegram for you, miss."" Tuppence took it from the salver, and tore it open carelessly. Then she gave a cry. The telegram was from Tommy! CHAPTER XVI. FURTHER ADVENTURES OF TOMMY FROM a darkness punctuated with throbbing stabs of fire, Tommy dragged his senses slowly back to life.

There was little in it but the tender assurance Suzette gave him of their love, and the anxiety of Adeline and herself to know how and where he was. She told him that he was not to feel troubled about them; that they were well, and unhappy only for him; but he must not think they blamed him, or had ever done so. As soon as they were sure they could reach him, she said, they would write to him again. Adeline wrote a few lines with her name, to say that for some days past she had not been quite well; but that she was better and had nothing to wish for but to hear from him. When Pinney came back a second time, he found Northwick with the letter open in his hand. ""Well, sir,"" he said, with the easy respectfulness toward Northwick that had been replacing, ever since he talked with Matt Hilary, the hail-fellow manner he used with most men, and that had now fully established itself, ""You\'ve got some noble scenery about here."" He meant to compliment Northwick on the beauty of the landscape, as people ascribe merit to the inhabitants of a flourishing city. Northwick, by his silence, neither accepted nor disclaimed the credit of the local picturesqueness; and Pinney ventured to add, ""But you seem to take it out in nature, Mr. Northwick. The place is pretty quiet, sir."" Northwick paid no heed to this observation, either;', 'than that they were well, and anxious to hear from him; and Pinney really knew nothing more about them. He had not been asked to Hatboro\' to see them before he started, and with all the will he had to invent comfortable and attractive circumstances for them, he was at a disadvantage for want of material. The most that he could conjecture was that Mr. Hilary\'s family had not broken off their friendly relations with them. He had heard old Hilary criticised for it, and he told Northwick so. ""I guess he\'s been standing by you, Mr. Northwick, as far as he consistently could,"" he said; and Northwick ventured to reply that he expected that. ""It was young Hilary who brought me the letter, and talked the whole thing up with me,"" Pinney added. Northwick had apparently not expected this; but he let no more than the fact appear. He kept silent for a time; then he said, ""And you don\'t know anything about the way they\'re living?"" ""No, I don\'t,"" said Pinney, with final candor. ""But I should say they were living along there about as usual. Mr. Hilary didn\'t say but what they were. I guess you haven\'t got any cause to be uneasy on that score. My idea is, Mr. Northwick, that they wanted to leave you just as free as they could about themselves. They wanted to find out your whereabouts in the land of the living, first of all. You know that till that letter', ""and when he did not talk of it, no one must mention it. Hilary felt the peculiar hardships of his position, all the more keenly because he had a conscience that would not permit him to shirk his duty. He had used his influence, the weight of his character and business repute, to control the action of the Board towards Northwick, when the defalcation became known, and now he was doubly bound to respond to the wishes of the directors in proceeding against him. Most of them believed that Northwick was still alive; those who were not sure regarded it as a public duty to have him indicted at any rate, and they all voted that Hilary should make the necessary complaint. Then Hilary had no choice but to obey. Another man in his place might have resigned, but he could not, for he knew that he was finally responsible for Northwick's escape. He made it no less his duty to find out just how much hardship it would work Northwick's daughters, and he tried to lend them money. But Suzette answered for both that her father had left them some money when he went away; and Hilary could only send Louise to explain how he must formally appear in the legal proceedings; he allowed Louise to put whatever warmth of color she wished into his regrets and into his advice that they should consult a lawyer.

He had remembered. He was in that sinister house in Soho. He uttered a groan and fell back. Through his almost-closed lids he reconnoitred carefully. ""He is coming to,"" remarked a voice very near Tommy's ear. He recognized it at once for that of the bearded and efficient German, and lay artistically inert. He felt that it would be a pity to come round too soon; and until the pain in his head became a little less acute, he felt quite incapable of collecting his wits. Painfully he tried to puzzle out what had happened. Obviously somebody must have crept up behind him as he listened and struck him down with a blow on the head. They knew him now for a spy, and would in all probability give him short shrift. Undoubtedly he was in a tight place. Nobody knew where he was, therefore he need expect no outside assistance, and must depend solely on his own wits. ""Well, here goes,"" murmured Tommy to himself, and repeated his former remark. ""Damn!"" he observed, and this time succeeded in sitting up. In a minute the German stepped forward and placed a glass to his lips, with the brief command ""Drink."" Tommy obeyed. The potency of the draught made him choke, but it cleared his brain in a marvellous manner.

He stepped through the door, knocking Beatrice\'s feet against the framework as he did so, closed it--to shut it he had no time--and stood gasping behind it. The gleam of light drew nearer. Merciful powers! he had been seen--the old man was coming in. What could he say? Tell the truth, that was all; but who would believe such a story? why, it was one that he should scarcely care to advance in a court of law. Could he expect a father to believe it--a father finding a man crouched like a thief behind a door at the dead of night with his lovely daughter senseless in his arms? He had already thought of going straight to Mr. Granger, but had abandoned the idea as hopeless. Who would believe this tale of sleep-walking? For the first time in his life Geoffrey felt terribly afraid, both for Beatrice and himself; the hair rose on his head, his heart stood still, and a cold perspiration started on to his face.

This done, he advanced on tiptoe to the open staircase door, passed through it, and secured it on the inner side as usual. Mr. Bashwood had seen him at the apparatus; Mr. Bashwood had noticed the manner of his withdrawal through the staircase door. Again the sense of an unutterable expectation throbbed at his heart. A terror that was slow and cold and deadly crept into his hands, and guided them in the dark to the key that had been left for him in the inner side of the door. He turned it in vague distrust of what might happen next, and waited. The slow minutes passed, and nothing happened. The silence was horrible; the solitude of the lonely corridor was a solitude of invisible treacheries. He began to count to keep his mind employed--to keep his own growing dread away from him. The numbers, as he whispered them, followed each other slowly up to a hundred, and still nothing happened. He had begun the second hundred; he had got on to twenty--when, without a sound to betray that he had been moving in his room, Midwinter suddenly appeared in the corridor.

A little thrill passed through him. Her delicately-curved lips were quivering as though with amusement, and her eyes had fallen; she had blushed slightly at that unwitting, ardent look of his. Mr. Sabin\'s cold voice recalled him to himself. ""I believe,"" he said, ""that I overheard your name correctly. It is Wolfenden, is it not?"" Wolfenden assented. ""I am sorry that I haven\'t a card,"" he said. ""That is my name."" Mr. Sabin looked at him curiously. ""Wolfenden is, I believe, the family name of the Deringhams? May I ask, are you any relation to Admiral Lord Deringham?"" Wolfenden was suddenly grave. ""Yes,"" he answered; ""he is my father. Did you ever meet him?"" Mr. Sabin shook his head. ""No, I have heard of him abroad; also, I believe, of the Countess of Deringham,', 'your aid last night. I was anxious to get away before any fuss was made, or I would have expressed my gratitude at the time in a more seemly fashion.""

At length the judge took his seat, and the clerk of the crown sat beneath him ready to record the decision of the jury. A few lighted candles were stuck about in different parts of the court; but they were lost in the obscurity of the large, dark, dismal building. The foreman stood ready with a written and signed paper. The judge asked him if they had all come to a unanimous verdict, and he answered in the affirmative; and handed the paper to the clerk of the peace, who glancing his eye upon it, and half turning round to the judge said in his peculiar, sonorous voice-- ""My lord, the prisoner has been found guilty."" ""Gentlemen, is that your verdict?"" said the judge; and they said it was. The prisoner stood up at the bar erect without moving. He neither shook nor trembled now. If it were not that his lips were pressed quite close together, he would have appeared to have heard the verdict without emotion. Not so Father John; he had been leaning back, anxiously waiting till the one fatal word met his ear; and then his head fell forward on the desk, and he sobbed like a woman.

As he did so, his voice seemed like some awful, measured tone proceeding from an immovable figure', 'of the jury with any further defence, he replied: “No, sir; I leave it for your honor to charge; I rest my case here.” “Mr. District Attorney,” said the Judge, “have you anything to say?” Mr. Van der School removed his spectacles, folded them and, replacing them once more on his nose, eyed the other bill which he held in his hand, and then said, looking at the bar over the top of his glasses; I shall rest the prosecution here, if the court please.” Judge Temple arose and began the charge. “Gentlemen of the jury,” he said, “you have heard the testimony, and I shall detain you but a moment. If an officer meet with resistance in the execution of a process, he has an undoubted right to call any citizen to his assistance; and the acts of such assistant come within the protection of the law. I shall leave you to judge, gentlemen, from the testimony, how far the witness in this prosecution can be so considered, feeling less reluctance to submit the case thus informally to your decision, because there is yet another indictment to be tried, which involves heavier charges against the unfortunate prisoner.” The tone of Marmaduke was mild and insinuating, and, as his sentiments were given with such apparent impartiality, they did not fail of carrying due weight with the jury. The grave-looking yeomen who composed this tribunal laid their heads together for a few minutes, without leaving the box, when the foreman arose,', 'they had to decide whether he had, in accordance with the theory of the prosecution, carried that threat into effect; or whether on the other hand, as the defense suggested, the deceased had fallen a victim to the agent of the association which had threatened his life. He was bound to tell them that if they entertained any doubt as to the guilt of the prisoner at the bar they were bound to give him the benefit of the doubt. The jury consulted together for a short time and then expressed their desire to retire to consider their verdict. They were absent about half an hour and on their return the foreman said in reply to the question of the judge that they found the prisoner ""Not Guilty."" A perfect silence reigned in the court when the jury entered the box, and something like a sigh of relief followed their verdict. It was expected, and indeed there was some surprise when the jury retired, for the general opinion was that whether guilty or innocent the prosecution had failed to bring home unmistakably the crime to the prisoner. That he might have committed it was certain, that he had committed it was probable, but it was assuredly not proved that he and none other had been the perpetrator of the crime.

May I ask, are you any relation to Admiral Lord Deringham?"" Wolfenden was suddenly grave. ""Yes,"" he answered; ""he is my father. Did you ever meet him?"" Mr. Sabin shook his head. ""No, I have heard of him abroad; also, I believe, of the Countess of Deringham,', 'your aid last night. I was anxious to get away before any fuss was made, or I would have expressed my gratitude at the time in a more seemly fashion."" ""I hope,"" Wolfenden said, ""that you will not think it necessary to say anything more about it. I did what any one in my place would have done without a moment\'s hesitation."" ""I am not quite so sure of that,"" Mr. Sabin said. ""But by the bye, can you tell me what became of the fellow? Did any one go after him?"" ""There was some sort of pursuit, I believe,"" Wolfenden said slowly, ""but he was not caught."" ""I am glad to hear it,"" Mr. Sabin said. Wolfenden looked at him in some surprise. He could not make up his mind whether it was his duty to disclose the name of the man who had made this strange attempt. ""Your assailant was, I suppose, a stranger to you?"" he said slowly. Mr. Sabin shook his head. ""By no means. I recognised him directly. So, I believe, did you."" Wolfenden was honestly amazed. ""He was your guest, I believe,"" Mr. Sabin continued, ""until I entered the room. I saw him leave, and I was half-prepared for something of the sort."" ""He was my guest, it is true, but none the less, he was a stranger to me,"" Wolfenden explained. ""He brought a letter from my cousin, who seems to have considered him a decent sort of fellow.""

Again there was a look in the German's eyes that Tommy did not quite understand. ""She will not be able to answer your question."" ""That does not matter. I shall have seen her face when I ask it."" ""And you think that will tell you anything?"" He gave a short disagreeable laugh. More than ever, Tommy felt that there was a factor somewhere that he did not understand. The German looked at him searchingly. ""I wonder whether, after all, you know as much as we think?"" he said softly. Tommy felt his ascendancy less sure than a moment before. His hold had slipped a little. But he was puzzled. What had he said wrong? He spoke out on the impulse of the moment. ""There may be things that you know which I do not. I have not pretended to be aware of all the details of your show. But equally I've got something up my sleeve that you don't know about. And that's where I mean to score. Danvers was a damned clever fellow----"" He broke off as if he had said too much. But the German's face had lightened a little. ""Danvers,"" he murmured. ""I see----"" He paused a minute, then waved to Conrad. ""Take him away. Upstairs--you know."" ""Wait a minute,"" said Tommy. ""What about the girl?"" ""That may perhaps be arranged."" ""It must be."" ""We will see about it.

I think he was a little surprised to hear himself saying this; but, as soon as it was said, he liked it. He was Captain Stroke playing in the Den again, after all, and playing as well as ever.

But Tommy had guessed that Elspeth was trembling behind the door, and he had called out, ""Don\'t cry, Elspeth; I am all right; it is nothing at all."" ""How noble!"" was Grizel\'s comment, when she heard of this; and then Elspeth was her friend again, insisted on her staying to tea, and went into the kitchen to prepare it. Aaron was out. The two were alone now, and in the circumstances some men would have given the lady the opportunity to apologize, if such was her desire. But Tommy\'s was a more generous nature; his manner was that of one less sorry to be misjudged than anxious that Grizel should not suffer too much from remorse. If she had asked his pardon then and there, I am sure he would have replied, ""Right willingly, Grizel,"" and begged her not to give another thought to the matter. What is of more importance, Grizel was sure of this also, and it was the magnanimity of him that especially annoyed her. There seemed to be no disturbing it. Even when she said, ""Which foot is it?"" he answered, ""The one', 'shake Corp by the hand again."" ""And Aaron,"" said Elspeth. She was knitting stockings for Aaron at that moment.

Tommy rose obediently. Outside the door his gaoler motioned to him to mount the stairs. He himself followed close behind. On the floor above Conrad opened a door and Tommy passed into a small room. Conrad lit a hissing gas burner and went out. Tommy heard the sound of the key being turned in the lock. He set to work to examine his prison. It was a smaller room than the one downstairs, and there was something peculiarly airless about the atmosphere of it. Then he realized that there was no window. He walked round it. The walls were filthily dirty, as everywhere else. Four pictures hung crookedly on the wall representing scenes from Faust. Marguerite with her box of jewels, the church scene, Siebel and his flowers, and Faust and Mephistopheles. The latter brought Tommy's mind back to Mr. Brown again. In this sealed and closed chamber, with its close-fitting heavy door, he felt cut off from the world, and the sinister power of the arch-criminal seemed more real. Shout as he would, no one could ever hear him. The place was a living tomb.... With an effort Tommy pulled himself together. He sank on to the bed and gave himself up to reflection. His head ached badly; also, he was hungry. The silence of the place was dispiriting. ""Anyway,"" said Tommy, trying to cheer himself, ""I",28,Hauntings in a dark room,28_darkness_haunted_door_light,"['darkness', 'haunted', 'door', 'light', 'candle', 'ghost', 'room', 'shadow', 'dark', 'silence']","['a flash of light it passed into his mind that the empty room was not two paces from him.

Merciful powers! he had been seen--the old man was coming in. What could he say? Tell the truth, that was all; but who would believe such a story? why, it was one that he should scarcely care to advance in a court of law. Could he expect a father to believe it--a father finding a man crouched like a thief behind a door at the dead of night with his lovely daughter senseless in his arms? He had already thought of going straight to Mr. Granger, but had abandoned the idea as hopeless. Who would believe this tale of sleep-walking? For the first time in his life Geoffrey felt terribly afraid, both for Beatrice and himself; the hair rose on his head, his heart stood still, and a cold perspiration started on to his face.

He turned it in vague distrust of what might happen next, and waited. The slow minutes passed, and nothing happened.

After that----"" After that Tommy was forced to admit the prospect looked dreary. CHAPTER XVII. ANNETTE THE troubles of the future, however, soon faded before the troubles of the present. And of these, the most immediate and pressing was that of hunger. Tommy had a healthy and vigorous appetite. The steak and chips partaken of for lunch seemed now to belong to another decade. He regretfully recognized the fact that he would not make a success of a hunger strike. He prowled aimlessly about his prison. Once or twice he discarded dignity, and pounded on the door. But nobody answered the summons. ""Hang it all!"" said Tommy indignantly. ""They can't mean to starve me to death."" A new-born fear passed through his mind that this might, perhaps, be one of those ""pretty ways"" of making a prisoner speak, which had been attributed to Boris. But on reflection he dismissed the idea. ""It's that sour faced brute Conrad,"" he decided. ""That's a fellow I shall enjoy getting even with one of these days. This is just a bit of spite on his part. I'm certain of it."" Further meditations induced in him the feeling that it would be extremely pleasant to bring something down with a whack on Conrad's egg-shaped head. Tommy stroked his own head tenderly, and gave himself up to the pleasures of imagination.

Where is mother?"" ""She is not here; she went to Garum the day before yesterday. I\'ll come down to the lower window."" ""Alone, Maggie?"" said Tom, in a voice of deep astonishment, as he opened the middle window, on a level with the boat. ""Yes, Tom; God has taken care of me, to bring me to you. Get in quickly. Is there no one else?"" ""No,"" said Tom, stepping into the boat; ""I fear the man is drowned; he was carried down the Ripple, I think, when part of the Mill fell with the crash of trees and stones against it; I\'ve shouted again and again, and there has been no answer. Give me the oars, Maggie."" It was not till Tom had pushed off and they were on the wide water,--he face to face with Maggie,--that the full meaning of what had happened rushed upon his mind. It came with so overpowering a force,--it was such a new revelation to his spirit, of the depths in life that had lain beyond his vision, which he had fancied so keen and clear,--that he was unable to ask a question.

Agatha Christie___The Secret Adversary.txt,"bright idea flashed across his brain. Why not convert imagination into reality? Conrad was undoubtedly the tenant of the house. The others, with the possible exception of the bearded German, merely used it as a rendezvous. Therefore, why not wait in ambush for Conrad behind the door, and when he entered bring down a chair, or one of the decrepit pictures, smartly on to his head. One would, of course, be careful not to hit too hard. And then--and then, simply walk out! If he met anyone on the way down, well----Tommy brightened at the thought of an encounter with his fists. Such an affair was infinitely more in his line than the verbal encounter of this afternoon. Intoxicated by his plan, Tommy gently unhooked the picture of the Devil and Faust, and settled himself in position. His hopes were high. The plan seemed to him simple but excellent. Time went on, but Conrad did not appear. Night and day were the same in this prison room, but Tommy's wrist-watch, which enjoyed a certain degree of accuracy, informed him that it was nine o'clock in the evening. Tommy reflected gloomily that if supper did not arrive soon it would be a question of waiting for breakfast. At ten o'clock hope deserted him, and he flung himself on the bed to seek consolation in sleep. In five minutes his woes were forgotten.

Then he remembered, and looked at his watch. It was eight o'clock. ""It's either early morning tea or breakfast,"" deduced the young man, ""and pray God it's the latter!"" The door swung open. Too late, Tommy remembered his scheme of obliterating the unprepossessing Conrad. A moment later he was glad that he had, for it was not Conrad who entered, but a girl. She carried a tray which she set down on the table. In the feeble light of the gas burner Tommy blinked at her. He decided at once that she was one of the most beautiful girls he had ever seen. Her hair was a full rich brown, with sudden glints of gold in it as though there were imprisoned sunbeams struggling in its depths. There was a wild-rose quality about her face. Her eyes, set wide apart, were hazel, a golden hazel that again recalled a memory of sunbeams. A delirious thought shot through Tommy's mind. ""Are you Jane Finn?"" he asked breathlessly. The girl shook her head wonderingly. ""My name is Annette, monsieur."" She spoke in a soft, broken English. ""Oh!"" said Tommy, rather taken aback. ""Francaise?"" he hazarded. ""Oui, monsieur.

And seeing the danger, he did not, like James, hide it away in sheer nervousness, but owned with the dispassion of his broader outlook, that it was not unlikely; there was something very attractive about Irene! He had a presentiment on the subject of Soames\' communication as they left the Board Room together, and went out into the noise and hurry of Cheapside. They walked together a good minute without speaking, Soames with his mousing, mincing step, and old Jolyon upright and using his umbrella languidly as a walking-stick. They turned presently into comparative quiet, for old Jolyon\'s way to a second Board led him in the direction of Moorage Street. Then Soames, without lifting his eyes, began: ""I\'ve had this letter from Bosinney. You see what he says; I thought I\'d let you know. I\'ve spent a lot more than I intended on this house, and I want the position to be clear."" Old Jolyon ran his eyes unwillingly over the letter: ""What he says is clear enough,"" he said. ""He talks about \'a free hand,\'"" replied Soames. Old Jolyon looked at him. The long-suppressed irritation and antagonism towards this young fellow, whose affairs were beginning to intrude upon his own, burst from him. ""Well, if you don\'t trust him, why do you employ him?"" Soames stole a sideway look: ""It\'s', 'I\'ve come. You\'re her trustee, I\'m told."" Jolyon nodded. ""Twelve years is a long time,"" said Soames rapidly: ""I--I\'m tired of it."" Jolyon found no more appropriate answer than: ""Won\'t you smoke?"" ""No, thanks."" Jolyon himself lit a cigarette. ""I wish to be free,"" said Soames abruptly. ""I don\'t see her,"" murmured Jolyon through the fume of his cigarette. ""But you know where she lives, I suppose?"" Jolyon nodded. He did not mean to give her address without permission. Soames seemed to divine his thought. ""I don\'t want her address,"" he said; ""I know it."" ""What exactly do you want?"" ""She deserted me. I want a divorce."" ""Rather late in the day, isn\'t it?"" ""Yes,"" said Soames. And there was a silence. ""I don\'t know much about these things--at least, I\'ve forgotten,"" said Jolyon with a wry smile. He himself had had to wait for death to grant him a divorce from the first Mrs. Jolyon. ""Do you wish me to see her about it?"" Soames raised his eyes to his cousin\'s face. ""I suppose there\'s someone,"" he said. A shrug moved Jolyon\'s shoulders. ""I don\'t know at all. I imagine you may have both lived as if the other were dead. It\'s usual in these cases."" Soames turned to the window. A few early fallen oak-leaves strewed the terrace already, and were rolling round in the wind. Jolyon saw the figures of Holly and Val Dartie moving across the lawn towards the stables. \'I\'m not going to run with', 'bandy words. I require you to give up this--friendship. I think of the matter entirely as it affects Fleur."" ""Ah!--Fleur!"" ""Yes,"" said Soames stubbornly; ""Fleur. She is your child as well as mine."" ""It is kind to admit that!"" ""Are you going to do what I say?"" ""I refuse to tell you."" ""Then I must make you."" Annette smiled. ""No, Soames,"" she said. ""You are helpless. Do not say things that you will regret."" Anger swelled the veins on his forehead. He opened his mouth to vent that emotion, and--could not. Annette went on: ""There shall be no more such letters, I promise you. That is enough."" Soames writhed. He had a sense of being treated like a child by this woman who had deserved he did not know what. ""When two people have married, and lived like us, Soames, they had better be quiet about each other. There are things one does not drag up into the light for people to laugh at. You will be quiet, then; not for my sake--for your own. You are getting old; I am not, yet. You have made me ver-ry practical."" Soames, who had passed through all the sensations of being choked, repeated dully: ""I require you to give up this friendship."" ""And if I do not?"" ""Then--then I will cut you out of my Will."" Somehow it did not seem to meet the case. Annette laughed. ""You will live a long time, Soames.""

The remark was unpleasant in its suggestion, but Tommy ignored it. He sat down at the table. ""Retire, varlet,"" he said, with a wave of his hand. ""Prate not to thy betters."" That evening Tommy sat on the bed, and cogitated deeply. Would Conrad again accompany the girl? If he did not, should he risk trying to make an ally of her? He decided that he must leave no stone unturned. His position was desperate. At eight o'clock the familiar sound of the key turning made him spring to his feet. The girl was alone.

""She's about your age too. Won't you save her from their clutches?"" ""You mean Jane Finn?"" ""Yes."" ""It is her you came here to look for? Yes?"" ""That's it."" The girl looked at him, then passed her hand across her forehead. ""Jane Finn. Always I hear that name. It is familiar."" Tommy came forward eagerly. ""You must know SOMETHING about her?"" But the girl turned away abruptly. ""I know nothing--only the name."" She walked towards the door. Suddenly she uttered a cry. Tommy stared. She had caught sight of the picture he had laid against the wall the night before. For a moment he caught a look of terror in her eyes. As inexplicably it changed to relief. Then abruptly she went out of the room. Tommy could make nothing of it. Did she fancy that he had meant to attack her with it? Surely not. He rehung the picture on the wall thoughtfully. Three more days went by in dreary inaction. Tommy felt the strain telling on his nerves. He saw no one but Conrad and Annette, and the girl had become dumb. She spoke only in monosyllables. A kind of dark suspicion smouldered in her eyes. Tommy felt that if this solitary confinement went on much longer he would go mad. He gathered from Conrad that they were waiting for orders from",141,Interpersonal relationships and communication among characters in Gemmell novel,141_grizel_grizels_elspeth_elspeths,"['grizel', 'grizels', 'elspeth', 'elspeths', 'tommy', 'tommys', 'cried', 'gemmell', 'loved', 'words']","['Elspeth at once? ""It is nothing,"" Tommy insisted, a little fiercely. ""He says so,"" Grizel explained, ""not to alarm us. But he is suffering horribly. Just before I called to you his face was all drawn up in pain."" This made the sufferer wince. ""That was another twinge,"" she said promptly. ""What is to be done, Elspeth?"" ""I think I could carry him,"" suggested Corp, with a forward movement that made Tommy stamp his foot--the wooden one. ""I am all right,"" he told them testily, and looking uneasily at Grizel. ""How brave of you to say so!"" said she. ""It is just like him,"" Elspeth said, pleased with Grizel\'s remark. ""I am sure it is,"" Grizel said, so graciously. It was very naughty of her. Had she given him a chance he would have explained that it was all a mistake of Grizel\'s. That had been his intention; but now a devil entered into Tommy and spoke for him. ""I must have slipped and sprained my ankle,"" he said. ""It is slightly painful; but I shall be able to walk home all right, Corp, if you let me use you as a staff."" I think he was a little surprised to hear himself saying this; but, as soon as it was said, he liked it. He was Captain Stroke playing in the Den again, after all, and playing as well as ever. Nothing being so real to Tommy as pretence, I daresay he even began to feel his ankle hurting', 'have endured more stoically though there had been nothing the matter with it."" ""It was soon over,"" Tommy replied lightly. ""I think Elspeth suffered more than I."" Elspeth told the story of his heroism. ""I could not stay in the room,"" she said; ""it was too terrible."" And Grizel despised too tender-hearted Elspeth for that; she was so courageous at facing pain herself. But Tommy had guessed that Elspeth was trembling behind the door, and he had called out, ""Don\'t cry, Elspeth; I am all right; it is nothing at all."" ""How noble!"" was Grizel\'s comment, when she heard of this; and then Elspeth was her friend again, insisted on her staying to tea, and went into the kitchen to prepare it. Aaron was out. The two were alone now, and in the circumstances some men would have given the lady the opportunity to apologize, if such was her desire. But Tommy\'s was a more generous nature; his manner was that of one less sorry to be misjudged than anxious that Grizel should not suffer too much from remorse. If she had asked his pardon then and there, I am sure he would have replied, ""Right willingly, Grizel,"" and begged her not to give another thought to the matter. What is of more importance, Grizel was sure of this also, and it was the magnanimity of him that especially annoyed her. There seemed to be no disturbing it. Even when she said, ""Which foot is it?"" he answered, ""The one', 'shake Corp by the hand again."" ""And Aaron,"" said Elspeth. She was knitting stockings for Aaron at that moment. ""And Gavinia,"" Tommy said, ""and the Dominie."" ""And Ailie."" And then came an awkward pause, for they were both thinking of that independent girl called Grizel. She was seldom discussed. Tommy was oddly shy about mentioning her name; he would have preferred Elspeth to mention it: and Elspeth had misgivings that this was so, with the result that neither could say ""Grizel"" without wondering what was in the other\'s mind. Tommy had written twice to Grizel, the first time unknown to Elspeth, but that was in the days when the ladies of the penny numbers were disturbing him, and, against his better judgment (for well he knew she would never stand it), he had begun his letter with these mad words: ""Dear Little Woman."" She did not answer this, but soon afterwards she wrote to Elspeth, and he was not mentioned in the letter proper, but it carried a sting in its tail. ""P.S.,"" it said ""How is Sentimental Tommy?"" None but a fiend in human shape could have written thus, and Elspeth put her protecting arms round her brother. ""Now we know what Grizel is,"" she said. ""I am done with her now."" But when Tommy had got back his wind he said nobly: ""I\'ll call her no names. If this is how she likes to repay me for--for all my kindnesses, let her.

But the evening of the third day brought a rude awakening. It was barely seven o'clock when he heard the tramp of footsteps outside in the passage. In another minute the door was flung open. Conrad entered. With him was the evil-looking Number 14. Tommy's heart sank at the sight of them. ""Evenin', gov'nor,"" said the man with a leer. ""Got those ropes, mate?"" The silent Conrad produced a length of fine cord. The next minute Number 14's hands, horribly dexterous, were winding the cord round his limbs, while Conrad held him down. ""What the devil----?"" began Tommy. But the slow, speechless grin of the silent Conrad froze the words on his lips. Number 14 proceeded deftly with his task. In another minute Tommy was a mere helpless bundle. Then at last Conrad spoke: ""Thought you'd bluffed us, did you? With what you knew, and what you didn't know. Bargained with us! And all the time it was bluff! Bluff! You know less than a kitten. But your number's up now all right, you b----swine."" Tommy lay silent. There was nothing to say. He had failed.

True, his question to Annette had proved that he was personally unacquainted with Jane Finn, but he had never pretended otherwise. The question now was, did Annette really know more? Were her denials intended primarily for the listeners? On that point he could come to no conclusion. But there was a more vital question that drove out all others. Could he, bound as he was, manage to cut his bonds? He essayed cautiously to rub the open blade up and down on the cord that bound his two wrists together. It was an awkward business, and drew a smothered ""Ow"" of pain from him as the knife cut into his wrist. But slowly and doggedly he went on sawing to and fro. He cut the flesh badly, but at last he felt the cord slacken. With his hands free, the rest was easy. Five minutes later he stood upright with some difficulty, owing to the cramp in his limbs. His first care was to bind up his bleeding wrist. Then he sat on the edge of the bed to think. Conrad had taken the key of the door, so he could expect little more assistance from Annette. The only outlet from the room was the door, consequently he would perforce have to wait until the two men returned to fetch him. But when they did... Tommy smiled!

There was now nothing to do but to wait. He waited. The night passed slowly. Tommy lived through an eternity of hours, but at last he heard footsteps. He stood upright, drew a deep breath, and clutched the picture firmly. The door opened. A faint light streamed in from outside. Conrad went straight towards the gas to light it. Tommy deeply regretted that it was he who had entered first. It would have been pleasant to get even with Conrad. Number 14 followed. As he stepped across the threshold, Tommy brought the picture down with terrific force on his head. Number 14 went down amidst a stupendous crash of broken glass. In a minute Tommy had slipped out and pulled to the door. The key was in the lock. He turned it and withdrew it just as Conrad hurled himself against the door from the inside with a volley of curses. For a moment Tommy hesitated. There was the sound of some one stirring on the floor below. Then the German's voice came up the stairs. ""Gott im Himmel! Conrad, what is it?"" Tommy felt a small hand thrust into his. Beside him stood Annette. She pointed up a rickety ladder that apparently led to some attics. ""Quick--up here!"" She dragged him after her up the ladder. In another moment they were standing in a",28,Hauntings in a dark room,28_darkness_haunted_door_light,"['darkness', 'haunted', 'door', 'light', 'candle', 'ghost', 'room', 'shadow', 'dark', 'silence']","['a flash of light it passed into his mind that the empty room was not two paces from him.

He stepped through the door, knocking Beatrice\'s feet against the framework as he did so, closed it--to shut it he had no time--and stood gasping behind it. The gleam of light drew nearer. Merciful powers! he had been seen--the old man was coming in. What could he say? Tell the truth, that was all; but who would believe such a story? why, it was one that he should scarcely care to advance in a court of law. Could he expect a father to believe it--a father finding a man crouched like a thief behind a door at the dead of night with his lovely daughter senseless in his arms? He had already thought of going straight to Mr. Granger, but had abandoned the idea as hopeless. Who would believe this tale of sleep-walking? For the first time in his life Geoffrey felt terribly afraid, both for Beatrice and himself; the hair rose on his head, his heart stood still, and a cold perspiration started on to his face.

This done, he advanced on tiptoe to the open staircase door, passed through it, and secured it on the inner side as usual. Mr. Bashwood had seen him at the apparatus; Mr. Bashwood had noticed the manner of his withdrawal through the staircase door. Again the sense of an unutterable expectation throbbed at his heart. A terror that was slow and cold and deadly crept into his hands, and guided them in the dark to the key that had been left for him in the inner side of the door. He turned it in vague distrust of what might happen next, and waited. The slow minutes passed, and nothing happened. The silence was horrible; the solitude of the lonely corridor was a solitude of invisible treacheries. He began to count to keep his mind employed--to keep his own growing dread away from him. The numbers, as he whispered them, followed each other slowly up to a hundred, and still nothing happened. He had begun the second hundred; he had got on to twenty--when, without a sound to betray that he had been moving in his room, Midwinter suddenly appeared in the corridor.

He closed the window, and, taking off his coat, barricaded the door with all the heaviest furniture in the room. With a feeling of perfect security, he complacently regarded his handiwork, and then, sitting on the edge of the bed, began to undress. He turned the lamp down a little, and reloading the empty chambers of his revolver, placed it by the side of the lamp on the drawers. Then, as he turned back the clothes, he fancied that something moved beneath them. As he paused, it dropped lightly from the other side of the bed to the floor. At first he sat, with knitted brows, trying to see what it was. He had only had a glimpse of it, but he certainly had an idea that it was alive. A rat perhaps. He got off the bed again with an oath, and, taking the lamp in his hand, peered cautiously about the floor. Twice he walked round the room in this fashion.

The girl put her finger to her lips. She crept to the top of the ladder and listened. The banging and beating on the door was terrific. The German and another were trying to force the door in. Annette explained in a whisper: ""They will think you are still inside. They cannot hear what Conrad says. The door is too thick."" ""I thought you could hear what went on in the room?"" ""There is a peep-hole into the next room. It was clever of you to guess. But they will not think of that--they are only anxious to get in."" ""Yes--but look here----"" ""Leave it to me.""

They walked together a good minute without speaking, Soames with his mousing, mincing step, and old Jolyon upright and using his umbrella languidly as a walking-stick. They turned presently into comparative quiet, for old Jolyon\'s way to a second Board led him in the direction of Moorage Street.

I want a divorce."" ""Rather late in the day, isn\'t it?"" ""Yes,"" said Soames. And there was a silence. ""I don\'t know much about these things--at least, I\'ve forgotten,"" said Jolyon with a wry smile. He himself had had to wait for death to grant him a divorce from the first Mrs. Jolyon. ""Do you wish me to see her about it?"" Soames raised his eyes to his cousin\'s face. ""I suppose there\'s someone,"" he said. A shrug moved Jolyon\'s shoulders. ""I don\'t know at all. I imagine you may have both lived as if the other were dead. It\'s usual in these cases."" Soames turned to the window.

""Are you going to do what I say?"" ""I refuse to tell you."" ""Then I must make you."" Annette smiled. ""No, Soames,"" she said. ""You are helpless. Do not say things that you will regret."" Anger swelled the veins on his forehead. He opened his mouth to vent that emotion, and--could not. Annette went on: ""There shall be no more such letters, I promise you. That is enough."" Soames writhed. He had a sense of being treated like a child by this woman who had deserved he did not know what. ""When two people have married, and lived like us, Soames, they had better be quiet about each other. There are things one does not drag up into the light for people to laugh at. You will be quiet, then; not for my sake--for your own. You are getting old; I am not, yet. You have made me ver-ry practical."" Soames, who had passed through all the sensations of being choked, repeated dully: ""I require you to give up this friendship."" ""And if I do not?"" ""Then--then I will cut you out of my Will."" Somehow it did not seem to meet the case. Annette laughed. ""You will live a long time, Soames.""

The front door opened and a hail of bullets followed him. Fortunately none of them hit him. He turned the corner of the square.

He heard the footsteps of his pursuers behind him, and redoubled his own pace. Once he got out of these by-ways he would be safe. There would be a policeman about somewhere--not that he really wanted to invoke the aid of the police if he could possibly do without it. It meant explanations, and general awkwardness.

The policeman cast a suspicious eye on him. Tommy felt slightly offended. Then, passing his hand over his face, he laughed. He had not shaved or washed for three days! What a guy he must look. He betook himself without more ado to a Turkish Bath establishment which he knew to be open all night. He emerged into the busy daylight feeling himself once more, and able to make plans. First of all, he must have a square meal. He had eaten nothing since midday yesterday. He turned into an A.B.C. shop and ordered eggs and bacon and coffee. Whilst he ate, he read a morning paper propped up in front of him. Suddenly he stiffened. There was a long article on Kramenin, who was described as the ""man behind Bolshevism"" in Russia, and who had just arrived in London--some thought as an unofficial envoy. His career was sketched lightly, and it was firmly asserted that he, and not the figurehead leaders, had been the author of the Russian Revolution. In the centre of the page was his portrait. ""So that's who Number 1 is,"" said Tommy with his mouth full of eggs and bacon. ""Not a doubt about it, I must push on."" He paid for his breakfast, and betook himself to Whitehall.

This confession, after it was brought to the Czar by Tolstoi, to whom Alexis gave it, was sent by him to the great council of state, to aid them in forming their opinion. The council were occupied for the space of a week in hearing the case, and then they drew up and signed their decision. The statement which they made began by acknowledging that they had not of themselves any original right to try such a question, the Czar himself, according to the ancient constitution of the empire, having sole and exclusive jurisdiction in all such affairs, without being beholden to his subjects in regard to them in any manner whatever; but, nevertheless, as the Czar had deemed it expedient to refer it to them, they accepted the responsibility, and, after having fully investigated the case, were now ready to pronounce judgment.

I had got my diploma with me, and some of my friends came forward and subscribed enough to rig me out in clothes and pay my passage.

If Mr. Gladstone’s decision was to have the anticipated effect, Mr. Parnell must be made aware of it before the meeting of the Irish party (Nov. 25). This according to custom was to be held at two o’clock in the afternoon, to choose their chairman for the session. Before the choice was made, both the leader and his political friends should know the view and the purpose that prevailed in the camp of their allies. Mr. Parnell kept himself invisible and inaccessible alike to English and Irish friends until a few minutes before the meeting. The Irish member who had seen Mr. Gladstone the previous evening, at the last moment was able to deliver the message that had been confided to him. Mr. Parnell replied that he should stand to his guns. The other members of the Irish party came together, and, wholly ignorant of the attitude taken by Mr. Gladstone, promptly and with hardly a word of discussion re-elected their leader to his usual post. The gravity of the unfortunate error (M155) committed in the failure to communicate the private message to the whole of the nationalist members, with or without Mr. Parnell’s leave, lay in the fact that it magnified and distorted Mr. Gladstone’s later intervention into a humiliating public ultimatum.

THE TELEGRAM BAFFLED for the moment, Tommy strolled into the restaurant, and ordered a meal of surpassing excellence. His four days' imprisonment had taught him anew to value good food. He was in the middle of conveying a particularly choice morsel of Sole a la Jeanette to his mouth, when he caught sight of Julius entering the room. Tommy waved a menu cheerfully, and succeeded in attracting the other's attention. At the sight of Tommy, Julius's eyes seemed as though they would pop out of his head. He strode across, and pump-handled Tommy's hand with what seemed to the latter quite unnecessary vigour. ""Holy snakes!"" he ejaculated. ""Is it really you?"" ""Of course it is.

With his growth in flesh, Bartley liked peace more and more. Marcia had consented to go down to Equity alone, that summer, for he had convinced her that during a heated political contest it would not do for him to be away from the paper. He promised to go down for her when she wished to come home; and it was easily arranged for her to travel as far as the Junction under Halleck's escort, when he went to join his sisters in the White Mountains. Bartley missed her and the baby at first. But he soon began to adjust himself with resignation to his solitude. They had determined to keep their maid over this summer, for they had so much trouble in replacing her the last time after their return; and Bartley said he should live very economically. It was quiet, and the woman kept the house cool and clean; she was a good cook, and when Bartley brought a man home to dinner she took an interest in serving it well. Bartley let her order the things from the grocer and butcher, for she knew what they were used to getting, and he had heard so much talk from Marcia about bills since he"", 'her of woman and of wife consecrated it. She kept the child in continual remembrance of him by talking of him, and by making her recognize the photographs in which Bartley had abundantly perpetuated himself; at night, when she folded the little one\'s hands for prayer, she made her pray God to take care of poor papa and send him home soon to mamma. She was beginning to canonize him. Her father came to see her as soon as he thought it best after Atherton\'s letter; and the old man had to endure talk of Bartley to which all her former praises were as refreshing shadows of defamation. She required him to agree with everything she said, and he could not refuse; she reproached him for being with herself the cause of all Bartley\'s errors, and he had to bear it without protest. At the end he could say nothing but ""Better come home with me, Marcia,"" and he suffered in meekness the indignation with which she rebuked him: ""I will stay in Bartley\'s house till he comes back to me. If he is dead, I will die here."" The old man had satisfied himself that Bartley had absconded in his own rascally right mind, and he accepted with tacit grimness the theory of the detectives that he had not gone to Europe alone. He paid back the money which Bartley had borrowed from Halleck, and he set himself as patiently as he could to bear with Marcia\'s obstinacy.

""No, the fellows at the office said she'd just gone out."" ""Gone shopping, I guess. I dropped her here in the car about an hour ago.

""Well,"" she added, ""I told Allen he was sure to be the first."" Agatha looked at her in evident bewilderment, but she nodded. ""Yes,"" she said, ""of course, I knew it would come. Everybody knows by now that you have fallen out with Gregory."" ""But, as I told you, I haven\'t fallen out with him."" ""Then you certainly haven\'t married him, and if you have said \'No\' to Harry Wyllard because you would sooner take Gregory after all, you\'re a singularly unwise young woman. Anyway, you\'ll have to meet him when he comes to supper. Allen\'s fond of a talk with Harry; I can\'t have him kept away."" ""I was a little afraid of that,"" said Agatha quietly. ""What makes the situation more difficult is that he told me he would ask me again."" Mrs. Hastings appeared thoughtful.

""Why did you do it?"" ""I thought you might save Gregory, if I told you."" ""That was all?"" Sally looked at her with incredulous eyes. ""No,"" answered Agatha simply, ""that was only part. It did not seem right that Gregory should go against Wyllard\'s wishes, and gamble the Range away on the wheat market."" She admitted it without hesitation, for she realized now exactly what had animated her to seek this painful interview. She was fighting Wyllard\'s battle, and that fact sustained her. Sally winced.

Sally looked at her with unveiled compassion, and Agatha did not shrink from it. ""Yes,"" she said, with a simplicity that became her, ""and Gregory must have someone to--take care of him.

""It is nothing,"" Tommy insisted, a little fiercely. ""He says so,"" Grizel explained, ""not to alarm us. But he is suffering horribly.

""I think I could carry him,"" suggested Corp, with a forward movement that made Tommy stamp his foot--the wooden one. ""I am all right,"" he told them testily, and looking uneasily at Grizel. ""How brave of you to say so!"" said she. ""It is just like him,"" Elspeth said, pleased with Grizel\'s remark. ""I am sure it is,"" Grizel said, so graciously. It was very naughty of her. Had she given him a chance he would have explained that it was all a mistake of Grizel\'s. That had been his intention; but now a devil entered into Tommy and spoke for him. ""I must have slipped and sprained my ankle,"" he said. ""It is slightly painful; but I shall be able to walk home all right, Corp, if you let me use you as a staff."" I think he was a little surprised to hear himself saying this; but, as soon as it was said, he liked it. He was Captain Stroke playing in the Den again, after all, and playing as well as ever.

""It was soon over,"" Tommy replied lightly. ""I think Elspeth suffered more than I."" Elspeth told the story of his heroism. ""I could not stay in the room,"" she said; ""it was too terrible."" And Grizel despised too tender-hearted Elspeth for that; she was so courageous at facing pain herself. But Tommy had guessed that Elspeth was trembling behind the door, and he had called out, ""Don\'t cry, Elspeth; I am all right; it is nothing at all."" ""How noble!"" was Grizel\'s comment, when she heard of this; and then Elspeth was her friend again, insisted on her staying to tea, and went into the kitchen to prepare it. Aaron was out. The two were alone now, and in the circumstances some men would have given the lady the opportunity to apologize, if such was her desire. But Tommy\'s was a more generous nature; his manner was that of one less sorry to be misjudged than anxious that Grizel should not suffer too much from remorse. If she had asked his pardon then and there, I am sure he would have replied, ""Right willingly, Grizel,"" and begged her not to give another thought to the matter. What is of more importance, Grizel was sure of this also, and it was the magnanimity of him that especially annoyed her. There seemed to be no disturbing it. Even when she said, ""Which foot is it?"" he answered, ""The one', 'shake Corp by the hand again."" ""And Aaron,"" said Elspeth. She was knitting stockings for Aaron at that moment. ""And Gavinia,"" Tommy said, ""and the Dominie."" ""And Ailie."" And then came an awkward pause, for they were both thinking of that independent girl called Grizel. She was seldom discussed. Tommy was oddly shy about mentioning her name; he would have preferred Elspeth to mention it: and Elspeth had misgivings that this was so, with the result that neither could say ""Grizel"" without wondering what was in the other\'s mind. Tommy had written twice to Grizel, the first time unknown to Elspeth, but that was in the days when the ladies of the penny numbers were disturbing him, and, against his better judgment (for well he knew she would never stand it), he had begun his letter with these mad words: ""Dear Little Woman."" She did not answer this, but soon afterwards she wrote to Elspeth, and he was not mentioned in the letter proper, but it carried a sting in its tail. ""P.S.,"" it said ""How is Sentimental Tommy?"" None but a fiend in human shape could have written thus, and Elspeth put her protecting arms round her brother. ""Now we know what Grizel is,"" she said. ""I am done with her now.""

""That's all right,"" he said quickly. ""Tuppence and I have been pals for years. Nothing more."" He lit a cigarette with a hand that shook ever so little. ""That's quite all right. Tuppence always said that she was looking out for----"" He stopped abruptly, his face crimsoning, but Julius was in no way discomposed. ""Oh, I guess it'll be the dollars that'll do the trick.

""I\'ll try,"" said Wyllard with a certain hesitation; and Mrs. Hastings turned to her companion as they drove away.

""Well,"" she added, ""I told Allen he was sure to be the first."" Agatha looked at her in evident bewilderment, but she nodded. ""Yes,"" she said, ""of course, I knew it would come. Everybody knows by now that you have fallen out with Gregory."" ""But, as I told you, I haven\'t fallen out with him."" ""Then you certainly haven\'t married him, and if you have said \'No\' to Harry Wyllard because you would sooner take Gregory after all, you\'re a singularly unwise young woman. Anyway, you\'ll have to meet him when he comes to supper. Allen\'s fond of a talk with Harry; I can\'t have him kept away."" ""I was a little afraid of that,"" said Agatha quietly. ""What makes the situation more difficult is that he told me he would ask me again."" Mrs. Hastings appeared thoughtful. ""In that case he will in all probability do it; but I don\'t think you need feel diffident about meeting him, especially as you can\'t help it.

""Why did you do it?"" ""I thought you might save Gregory, if I told you."" ""That was all?"" Sally looked at her with incredulous eyes. ""No,"" answered Agatha simply, ""that was only part. It did not seem right that Gregory should go against Wyllard\'s wishes, and gamble the Range away on the wheat market."" She admitted it without hesitation, for she realized now exactly what had animated her to seek this painful interview. She was fighting Wyllard\'s battle, and that fact sustained her. Sally winced. ""Yes"" she agreed, ""I guess you had to tell me. He was fond of you. One could be proud of that. Harry Wyllard never did anything low down and mean."" Agatha did not resent her candor. Although this was a thing she would scarcely have credited a little while ago, she saw that the girl felt the contrast between Gregory\'s character and that of the man whose place he had taken, and regretted it. Agatha\'s eyes became dim with unshed tears. ""Wyllard, they think, is dead,"" she said, in a low voice. ""You have Gregory still."" Sally looked at her with unveiled compassion, and Agatha did not shrink from', 'be proud of that. Harry Wyllard never did anything low down and mean."" Agatha did not resent her candour. Although this was a thing she would scarcely have credited a little while ago, she saw that the girl felt the contrast between her lover\'s character and that of the man whose place he had taken, and regretted it.

Sally looked at her with unveiled compassion, and Agatha did not shrink from it. ""Yes,"" she said, with a simplicity that became her, ""and Gregory must have someone to--take care of him.

Agatha Christie___The Secret Adversary.txt,"along together very well."" Tommy looked at him curiously for a minute, as though he were about to speak, then changed his mind and said nothing. Tuppence and Julius! Well, why not? Had she not lamented the fact that she knew no rich men? Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she ever had the chance? Her meeting with the young American millionaire had given her the chance--and it was unlikely she would be slow to avail herself of it. She was out for money. She had always said so. Why blame her because she had been true to her creed? Nevertheless, Tommy did blame her. He was filled with a passionate and utterly illogical resentment. It was all very well to SAY things like that--but a REAL girl would never marry for money. Tuppence was utterly cold-blooded and selfish, and he would be delighted if he never saw her again! And it was a rotten world! Julius's voice broke in on these meditations. ""Yes, we ought to get along together very well. I've heard that a girl always refuses you once--a sort of convention."" Tommy caught his arm. ""Refuses? Did you say REFUSES?"" ""Sure thing. Didn't I tell you that? She just rapped out a 'no' without any kind of reason to it. The eternal feminine, the Huns call it, I've heard. But she'll come round right enough. Likely enough, I hustled her some----"" But Tommy interrupted regardless of decorum.

""Or to the bearer of it?"" ""Ah;--there I must not boast. But in simple truth there is only the father\'s ill-will between us."" ""With plenty of money on both sides?"" asked the Duchess. Lopez shrugged his shoulders. A shrug at such a time may mean anything, but the Duchess took this shrug as signifying that the question was so surely settled as to admit of no difficulty. ""Then,"" said the Duchess, ""the old gentleman may as well give way at once. Of course his daughter will be too many for him."" In this way the Duchess of Omnium became the fast friend of Ferdinand Lopez. CHAPTER XXII St. James\'s Park Towards the end of September Everett Wharton and Ferdinand Lopez were in town together, and as no one else was in town,--so at least they both professed to say,--they saw a good deal of each other. Lopez, as we know, had spent a portion of the preceding month at Gatherum Castle, and had made good use of his time, but Everett Wharton had been less fortunate. He had been a little cross with his father, and perhaps a little cross with all the Whartons generally, who did not, he thought, make quite enough of him. In the event', 'of my daughter that she should tear you from her affections, because--because you are not just such as I would have her husband to be. You have my permission to see her."" Then, before Lopez could say a word, he left the room, and took his hat and hurried away to his club. As he went he was aware that he had made no terms at all;--but then he was inclined to think that no terms should be made. There seemed to be a general understanding that Lopez was doing well in the world,--in a profession of the working of which Mr. Wharton himself knew absolutely nothing. He had a large fortune at his own bestowal,--intended for his daughter,--which would have been forthcoming at the moment and paid down on the nail, had she married Arthur Fletcher. The very way in which the money should be invested and tied up and made to be safe and comfortable to the Fletcher-cum-Wharton interests generally, had been fully settled among them. But now this other man, this stranger, this Portuguese, had entered in upon the inheritance. But the stranger, the Portuguese, must wait. Mr. Wharton knew himself to be an old man. She was his child, and he would not wrong her. But she should have her money closely settled upon herself on his death,--and on her children, should she then have any. It should be done by his will. He would say nothing about money to Lopez, and if Lopez should, as', 'to be sent. Do not look like that, papa. I know what I have done, and I must bear it. I have thrown away my life. It is just that. If baby had lived it would have been different."" This was about the end of January, and then Mr. Wharton heard of the great attack made by Mr. Quintus Slide against the Prime Minister, and heard, of course, of the payment alleged to have been made to Ferdinand Lopez by the Duke on the score of the election at Silverbridge. Some persons spoke to him on the subject. One or two friends at the club asked him what he supposed to be the truth in the matter, and Mrs. Roby inquired of him on the subject. ""I have asked Lopez,"" she said, ""and I am sure from his manner that he did get the money."" ""I don\'t know anything about it,"" said Mr. Wharton. ""If he did get it I think he was very clever."" It was well known at this time to Mrs. Roby that the Lopez marriage had been a failure, that Lopez was not a rich man, and that Emily, as well as her father, was discontented and unhappy. She had latterly heard of the Guatemala scheme, and had of course expressed her horror. But she sympathised with Lopez rather than with his wife, thinking that if Mr. Wharton would only open his pockets wide enough things might still be right.

""But you might as well see for yourself if you don't believe me."" The note, in Tuppence's well-known schoolboy writing, ran as follows: ""DEAR JULIUS, ""It's always better to have things in black and white. I don't feel I can be bothered to think of marriage until Tommy is found. Let's leave it till then. ""Yours affectionately, ""TUPPENCE."" Tommy handed it back, his eyes shining. His feelings had undergone a sharp reaction. He now felt that Tuppence was all that was noble and disinterested. Had she not refused Julius without hesitation? True, the note betokened signs of weakening, but he could excuse that. It read almost like a bribe to Julius to spur him on in his efforts to find Tommy, but he supposed she had not really meant it that way. Darling Tuppence, there was not a girl in the world to touch her! When he saw her----His thoughts were brought up with a sudden jerk. ""As you say,"" he remarked, pulling himself together, ""there's not a hint here as to what she's up to. Hi--Henry!"" The small boy came obediently. Tommy produced five shillings. ""One thing more.

Madame de Bellegarde closed her eyes and gave a little cough, which, as a piece of dissimulation, struck Newman as really heroic. ""Dear mother,"" said the marquis, ""does this stuff amuse you so much?"" ""The rest is more amusing,"" said Newman. ""You had better not lose it."" Madame de Bellegarde opened her eyes; the scintillations had gone out of them; they were fixed and dead. But she smiled superbly with her narrow little lips, and repeated Newman\'s word. ""Amusing? Have I killed some one else?"" ""I don\'t count your daughter,"" said Newman, ""though I might! Your husband knew what you were doing. I have a proof of it whose existence you have never suspected."" And he turned to the marquis, who was terribly white--whiter than Newman had ever seen any one out of a picture. ""A paper written by the hand, and signed with the name, of Henri-Urbain de Bellegarde. Written after you, madame, had left him for dead, and while you, sir, had gone--not very fast--for the doctor."" The marquis looked at his mother; she turned away, looking vaguely round her. ""I must sit down,"" she said in a low tone, going toward the bench on which Newman had been sitting. ""Couldn\'t you have spoken to me alone?"" said the marquis to Newman, with a strange look. ""Well, yes, if I could have been sure of speaking to your mother alone, too,"" Newman answered. ""But I have had to take you as I could get you."" Madame de', 'man?"" he asked, eying him askance. ""Well, I hope so,"" said Newman. ""I rather suspect so. In that case, come again."" ""Ah, what an invitation!"" murmured Madame de Cintre, with something painful in her smile. ""Oh, I want Mr. Newman to come--particularly,"" said the young man. ""It will give me great pleasure. I shall be desolate if I miss one of his visits. But I maintain he must be brave. A stout heart, sir!"" And he offered Newman his hand. ""I shall not come to see you; I shall come to see Madame de Cintre,"" said Newman. ""You will need all the more courage."" ""Ah, Valentin!"" said Madame de Cintre, appealingly. ""Decidedly,"" cried Madame de Bellegarde, ""I am the only person here capable of saying something polite! Come to see me; you will need no courage,"" she said. Newman gave a laugh which was not altogether an assent, and took his leave. Madame de Cintre did not take up her sister\'s challenge to be gracious, but she looked with a certain troubled air at the retreating guest. CHAPTER VII One evening very late, about a week after his visit to Madame de Cintre, Newman\'s servant brought him a card. It was that of young M. de Bellegarde. When, a few moments later, he went to receive his visitor, he found him standing in the middle of his great gilded parlor and eying it from cornice to carpet. M. de Bellegarde\'s face, it seemed to Newman, expressed a sense of lively', 'like him,"" said Newman, genially. ""He amuses you, eh?"" ""Yes, perfectly."" ""Do you hear that, Valentin?"" said Madame de Bellegarde. ""You amuse Mr. Newman."" ""Perhaps we shall all come to that!"" Valentin exclaimed. ""You must see my other son,"" said Madame de Bellegarde. ""He is much better than this one. But he will not amuse you."" ""I don\'t know--I don\'t know!"" murmured Valentin, reflectively. ""But we shall very soon see. Here comes Monsieur mon frere."" The door had just opened to give ingress to a gentleman who stepped forward and whose face Newman remembered. He had been the author of our hero\'s discomfiture the first time he tried to present himself to Madame de Cintre. Valentin de Bellegarde went to meet his brother, looked at him a moment, and then, taking him by the arm, led him up to Newman. ""This is my excellent friend Mr. Newman,"" he said very blandly. ""You must know him."" ""I am delighted to know Mr. Newman,"" said the marquis with a low bow, but without offering his hand. ""He is the old woman at second-hand,"" Newman said to himself, as he returned M. de Bellegarde\'s greeting. And this was the starting-point of a speculative theory, in his mind, that the late marquis had been a very amiable foreigner, with an inclination to take life easily and a sense that it was difficult for the husband of the stilted little lady by the fire to do so.

They hurried upstairs. Tuppence had left the key in her door. The room was as she had left it. In the fireplace was a crumpled ball of orange and white. Tommy disentangled it and smoothed out the telegram. ""Come at once, Moat House, Ebury, Yorkshire, great developments--TOMMY."" They looked at each other in stupefaction. Julius spoke first: ""You didn't send it?"" ""Of course not. What does it mean?"" ""I guess it means the worst,"" said Julius quietly. ""They've got her."" ""WHAT?"" ""Sure thing! They signed your name, and she fell into the trap like a lamb."" ""My God! What shall we do?"" ""Get busy, and go after her! Right now! There's no time to waste.

Left to himself, Tommy would probably have sat down to think things out for a good half-hour before he decided on a plan of action. But with Julius Hersheimmer about, hustling was inevitable. After a few muttered imprecations he handed the Bradshaw to Tommy as being more conversant with its mysteries. Tommy abandoned it in favour of an A.B.C. ""Here we are. Ebury, Yorks.

Blanche looked round at the sleeping Geoffrey. ""And _he_ knows!"" she said. ""It\'s maddening, uncle, to look at the brute snoring in his chair!"" Sir Patrick held up a warning hand. Before a word more could be said between them they were silenced again by another interruption. The whist-party comprised Lady Lundie and the surgeon, playing as partners against Smith and Jones. Arnold sat behind the surgeon, taking a lesson in the game. One, Two, and Three, thus left to their own devices, naturally thought of the billiard-table; and, detecting Geoffrey asleep in his corner, advanced to disturb his slumbers, under the all-sufficing apology of ""Pool."" Geoffrey roused himself, and rubbed his eyes, and said, drowsily, ""All right."" As he rose, he looked at the opposite corner in which Sir Patrick and his niece were sitting. Blanche\'s self-possession, resolutely as she struggled to preserve it, was not strong enough to keep her eyes from turning toward Geoffrey with an expression which betrayed the reluctant interest that she now felt in him. He stopped, noticing something entirely new in the look with which the young lady was regarding him. ""Beg your pardon,"" said Geoffrey. ""Do you wish to speak to me?"" Blanche\'s face flushed all over. Her uncle came to the rescue. ""Miss Lundie and I hope you have slept well Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick, jocosely. ""That\'s all."" ""Oh? That\'s all?"" said Geoffrey still', 'looked like himself again. ""Why go indoors this lovely weather?"" he said. ""Suppose we take a turn in the garden?"" Blanche pressed Anne\'s hand significantly. The proposal was evidently made for a purpose. They turned the corner of the cottage and gained the large garden at the back--the two ladies walking together, arm in arm; Sir Patrick and Geoffrey following them. Little by little, Blanche quickened her pace. ""I have got my instructions,"" she whispered to Anne. ""Let\'s get out of his hearing."" It was more easily said than done. Geoffrey kept close behind them. ""Consider my lameness, Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick. ""Not quite so fast."" It was well intended. But Geoffrey\'s cunning had taken the alarm. Instead of dropping behind with Sir Patrick, he called to his wife. ""Consider Sir Patrick\'s lameness,"" he repeated. ""Not quite so fast."" Sir Patrick met that check with characteristic readiness. When Anne slackened her pace, he addressed himself to Geoffrey, stopping deliberately in the middle of the path. ""Let me give you my message from Holchester House,"" he said. The two ladies were still slowly walking on. Geoffrey was placed between the alternatives of staying with Sir Patrick and leaving them by themselves--or of following them and leaving Sir Patrick. Deliberately, on his side, he followed the ladies. Sir Patrick called him back. ""I told you I wished to speak to you,"" he said, sharply. Driven to bay, Geoffrey openly revealed his resolution to give Blanche no opportunity of speaking in private', 'look at Anne. The look was not returned--was not even seen. From the moment when she had taken her place by Sir Patrick, Anne\'s eyes had rested on Blanche. They never moved--they never for an instant lost their tender sadness--when the woman who hated her spoke. All that was beautiful and true in that noble nature seemed to find its one sufficient encouragement in Blanche. As she looked once more at the sister of the unforgotten days of old, its native beauty of expression shone out again in her worn and weary face. Every man in the room (but Geoffrey) looked at her; and every man (but Geoffrey) felt for her. Sir Patrick addressed a second question to his sister-in-law. ""Is there any one here to represent the interests of Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn?"" he asked. Lady Lundie referred Sir Patrick to Geoffrey himself. Without looking up, Geoffrey motioned with his big brown hand to Mr. Moy, sitting by his side. Mr. Moy (holding the legal rank in Scotland which corresponds to the rank held by solicitors in England) rose and bowed to Sir Patrick, with the courtesy due to a man eminent in his time at the Scottish Bar. ""I represent Mr. Delamayn,"" he said. ""I congratulate myself, Sir Patrick, on having your ability and experience to appeal to in the conduct of the pending inquiry."" Sir Patrick returned the compliment as well as the bow. ""It is I who should learn from you,"" he answered.

But it gets my goat to think of that innocent young girl in danger!"" Tommy nodded abstractedly. He was thinking. In a moment or two, he said: ""I say, Julius, what do they want her for, anyway?"" ""Eh? I don't get you?"" ""What I mean is that I don't think it's their game to do her any harm,"" explained Tommy, puckering his brow with the strain of his mental processes.

Then she saw familiar dark faces; they belonged to men of Kells\'s Legion. And with his broad back to her there sat the giant Gulden. Already he and his allies had gotten together in defiance of or indifference to Kells\'s orders. Some of them were already under the influence of drink, but, though they saw Kells, they gave no sign of recognition. Gulden did not see Joan, and for that she was thankful. And whether or not his presence caused it, the fact was that she suddenly felt as much of a captive as she had in Cabin Gulch, and feared that here escape would be harder because in a community like this Kells would watch her closely. Kells led Joan and Cleve from one part of the smoky hall to another, and they looked on at the games and the strange raw life manifested there. The place was getting packed with men. Kells\'s party encountered Blicky and Beady Jones together. They passed by as strangers. Then Joan saw Beard and Chick Williams arm in arm, strolling about, like roystering miners. Williams telegraphed a keen, fleeting glance at Kells, then went on, to be lost in the crowd. Handy Oliver brushed by Kells, jostled him, apparently by accident, and he said, ""Excuse me, mister!"" There were other familiar faces. Kells\'s gang were all in Alder Creek and the dark machinations of the bandit leader had been put into operation. What struck Joan forcibly was that, though there', 'night\'s luck,"" said Bate Wood. ""Have any of you seen young Cleve?"" Kells went on. His voice rang quick and sharp. No one spoke, and presently Kells cracked his fist into his open hand. ""Come on. Get the gang together at Beard\'s.... Boys, the time we\'ve been gambling on has come. Jesse Smith saw \'49 and \'51. He wouldn\'t send me word like this--unless there was hell to pay.... Come on!"" He strode off down the slope with the men close around him, and they met other men on the way, all of whom crowded into the group, jostling, eager, gesticulating. Joan was left alone. She felt considerably perturbed, especially at Kells\'s sharp inquiry for Jim Cleve. Kells might persuade him to join that bandit legion. These men made Joan think of wolves, with Kells the keen and savage leader. No one had given a thought to Blicky\'s horse and that neglect in border men was a sign of unusual preoccupation. The horse was in bad shape. Joan took off his saddle and bridle, and rubbed the dust-caked lather from his flanks, and led him into the corral. Then she fetched a bucket of water and let him drink sparingly, a little at a time. Joan did not take her ride that morning. Anxious and curious, she waited for the return of Kells. But he did not come. All afternoon Joan waited and watched, and saw no sign of him or any of the other men. She knew Kells was', 'of hoofs as a horse galloped away from the cabin, after which a knock sounded on the wall. ""Joan,"" called Kells. Then the curtain was swept aside and Kells, appearing pale and troubled, stepped into her room. ""What\'s the matter?"" asked Joan, hurriedly. ""Gulden shot two men this morning. One\'s dead. The other\'s in bad shape, so Red tells me. I haven\'t seen him."" ""Who--who are they?"" faltered Joan. She could not think of any man except Jim Cleve. ""Dan Small\'s the one\'s dead. The other they call Dick. Never heard his last name."" ""Was it a fight?"" ""Of course. And Gulden picked it. He\'s a quarrelsome man. Nobody can go against him.

Kells seemed gloomy and concentrated on his situation and he talked naturally to Joan, as if she were one to sympathize. A bandit, then, in the details of his life, the schemes, troubles, friendships, relations, was no different from any other kind of a man. He was human, and things that might constitute black evil for observers were dear to him, a part of him. Joan feigned the sympathy she could not feel. ""I thought Gulden was your enemy.""

It was beginning to rain, and they turned up the collars of their coats as they trudged through the slush of the road. Suddenly Tommy halted. ""Wait a moment."" He ran back to the station and tackled the porter anew. ""Look here, do you remember a young lady who arrived by an earlier train, the 12.50 from London? She'd probably ask you the way to the Moat House."" He described Tuppence as well as he could, but the porter shook his head. Several people had arrived by the train in question. He could not call to mind one young lady in particular. But he was quite certain that no one had asked him the way to the Moat House. Tommy rejoined Julius, and explained.

He thundered away across the vineyards, and in a very few minutes I had placed miles between myself and my pursuers. They could no longer tell, in that wild country, in which direction I had gone.

They were well under way, looking only to their horses, when the second captive slipped his right arm from the bonds and succeeded in grasping the reins that lay trailing on the horse's neck. A sudden _vaquero_ jerk, which the well-trained animal understood, threw him on his haunches with his forelegs firmly planted on the slope. The rest of the cavalcade swept on; the man who was leading the captive's horse by the _riata_, thinking only of another accident, dropped the line to save himself from being dragged backwards from his horse. The captive wheeled, and the next moment was galloping furiously up the slope. It was the work of a moment; a trained horse and an experienced hand. The cavalcade had covered nearly fifty yards before they could pull up; the freed captive had covered half that distance uphill. The road was so narrow that only two shots could be fired, and these broke dust two yards ahead of the fugitive. They had not dared to fire low; the horse was the more valuable animal. The fugitive knew this in his extremity also, and would have gladly taken a shot in his own leg to spare that of his horse. Five men were detached to recapture or kill him. The latter seemed inevitable.

While I was sitting on a log, looking down the road the way that I had come, a man came in sight riding on a good-looking horse. The very moment I saw him, I was determined to have his horse, if he was in the garb of a traveler. He rode up, and I saw from his equipage that he was a traveler. I arose and drew an elegant rifle pistol on him and ordered him to dismount. He did so, and I took his horse by the bridle and pointed down the creek, and ordered him to walk before me. He went a few hundred yards and stopped. I hitched his horse, and then made him undress himself, all to his shirt and drawers, and ordered him to turn his back to me. He said, 'If you are determined to kill me, let me have time to pray before I die,' I told him I had no time to hear him pray.

It was like walking in a world of ghosts. Overhead the branches flapped and creaked with a mournful note. Occasionally a sodden leaf drifted silently down, startling them with its cold touch on their cheek. A turn of the drive brought them in sight of the house. That, too, seemed empty and deserted. The shutters were closed, the steps up to the door overgrown with moss. Was it indeed to this desolate spot that Tuppence had been decoyed? It seemed hard to believe that a human footstep had passed this way for months. Julius jerked the rusty bell handle. A jangling peal rang discordantly, echoing through the emptiness within. No one came. They rang again and again--but there was no sign of life. Then they walked completely round the house. Everywhere silence, and shuttered windows. If they could believe the evidence of their eyes the place was empty. ""Nothing doing,"" said Julius. They retraced their steps slowly to the gate.

It is, of course, a very conspicuous object from all the region around. The hill is long and narrow. The length of it extends from north to south. The northern end is the high end. The land slopes gently towards the south, but the other sides are steep, and in many places they form perpendicular precipices of rock, with the castle walls built on the very brink of them. The town lies chiefly at the foot of the hill, towards the south, though there are one or two streets, bordered by quaint and queer old buildings, that lead all the way up to the castle. In front of the castle, at the place where these streets terminate, is a broad space, smoothly gravelled, called the esplanade. This is used as a parade ground, for drilling and training the new soldiers, and teaching them the manoeuvres and exercises necessary to be practised in the war. On Sunday morning, after breakfast, Mr. George and the boys went out, to go to church. Bells were ringing in various parts of the town. They were drawn, by some invisible attraction, up the hill, in the direction of the castle. They soon found other people going the same way; and following them, they came, at length, to a very ancient-looking mass of buildings, which, Mr. George said, he should have thought was an old abbey, gone to ruin, if it were not that the people were all going into it, under', 'reading within the gateway, and, on my request for admittance, he civilly appointed one of the soldiers to conduct us to the castle. As I recollect, the chief gateway of the castle, with the guard-room in the thickness of the wall, is situated some twenty yards behind the first entrance where we met the sentinel. It was an intelligent young soldier who showed as round the castle, and very civil, as I always find soldiers to be. He had not anything particularly interesting to show, nor very much to say about it; and what be did say, so far as it referred to the history of the castle, was probably apocryphal. The castle has an inner and outer ward on the descent of the hill; and included within the circuit of the exterior wall. Having been always occupied by soldiers, it has not been permitted to assume the picturesque aspect of a ruin, but the buildings of the interior have either been constantly repaired, as they required it, or have been taken down when past repair. We saw a small part of the tower where Mary, Queen of Scots, was confined on her first coming to England; these remains consist only of a portion of a winding stone staircase, at which we glanced through a window.

In very truth, though a portion of the castle was undoubtedly old, and had been built when strength was needed for defence and probably for the custody of booty,--the battlements, and the round tower, and the awe-inspiring gateway had all been added by one of the late Sir Florians.

They were baffled--but not discouraged. Finally they altered their tactics. Tuppence had certainly not remained long in the neighbourhood of the Moat House. That pointed to her having been overcome and carried away in a car. They renewed inquiries. Had anyone seen a car standing somewhere near the Moat House that day? Again they met with no success. Julius wired to town for his own car, and they scoured the neighbourhood daily with unflagging zeal.

Julius was like a hound on the leash. He followed up the slenderest clue. Every car that had passed through the village on the fateful day was tracked down. He forced his way into country properties and submitted the owners of the motors to a searching cross-examination. His apologies were as thorough as his methods, and seldom failed in disarming the indignation of his victims; but, as day succeeded day, they were no nearer to discovering Tuppence's whereabouts.

""I think I could carry him,"" suggested Corp, with a forward movement that made Tommy stamp his foot--the wooden one. ""I am all right,"" he told them testily, and looking uneasily at Grizel. ""How brave of you to say so!"" said she. ""It is just like him,"" Elspeth said, pleased with Grizel\'s remark. ""I am sure it is,"" Grizel said, so graciously. It was very naughty of her. Had she given him a chance he would have explained that it was all a mistake of Grizel\'s. That had been his intention; but now a devil entered into Tommy and spoke for him. ""I must have slipped and sprained my ankle,"" he said. ""It is slightly painful; but I shall be able to walk home all right, Corp, if you let me use you as a staff."" I think he was a little surprised to hear himself saying this; but, as soon as it was said, he liked it. He was Captain Stroke playing in the Den again, after all, and playing as well as ever. Nothing being so real to Tommy as pretence, I daresay he even began to feel his ankle hurting', 'have endured more stoically though there had been nothing the matter with it."" ""It was soon over,"" Tommy replied lightly. ""I think Elspeth suffered more than I."" Elspeth told the story of his heroism. ""I could not stay in the room,"" she said; ""it was too terrible."" And Grizel despised too tender-hearted Elspeth for that; she was so courageous at facing pain herself. But Tommy had guessed that Elspeth was trembling behind the door, and he had called out, ""Don\'t cry, Elspeth; I am all right; it is nothing at all."" ""How noble!"" was Grizel\'s comment, when she heard of this; and then Elspeth was her friend again, insisted on her staying to tea, and went into the kitchen to prepare it. Aaron was out. The two were alone now, and in the circumstances some men would have given the lady the opportunity to apologize, if such was her desire. But Tommy\'s was a more generous nature; his manner was that of one less sorry to be misjudged than anxious that Grizel should not suffer too much from remorse. If she had asked his pardon then and there, I am sure he would have replied, ""Right willingly, Grizel,"" and begged her not to give another thought to the matter. What is of more importance, Grizel was sure of this also, and it was the magnanimity of him that especially annoyed her. There seemed to be no disturbing it. Even when she said, ""Which foot is it?"" he answered, ""The one', 'shake Corp by the hand again."" ""And Aaron,"" said Elspeth. She was knitting stockings for Aaron at that moment. ""And Gavinia,"" Tommy said, ""and the Dominie."" ""And Ailie."" And then came an awkward pause, for they were both thinking of that independent girl called Grizel. She was seldom discussed. Tommy was oddly shy about mentioning her name; he would have preferred Elspeth to mention it: and Elspeth had misgivings that this was so, with the result that neither could say ""Grizel"" without wondering what was in the other\'s mind. Tommy had written twice to Grizel, the first time unknown to Elspeth, but that was in the days when the ladies of the penny numbers were disturbing him, and, against his better judgment (for well he knew she would never stand it), he had begun his letter with these mad words: ""Dear Little Woman."" She did not answer this, but soon afterwards she wrote to Elspeth, and he was not mentioned in the letter proper, but it carried a sting in its tail. ""P.S.,"" it said ""How is Sentimental Tommy?"" None but a fiend in human shape could have written thus, and Elspeth put her protecting arms round her brother. ""Now we know what Grizel is,"" she said. ""I am done with her now."" But when Tommy had got back his wind he said nobly: ""I\'ll call her no names. If this is how she likes to repay me for--for all my kindnesses, let her.

""I wonder----"" The lawyer tapped the table thoughtfully. Something in his voice made Tommy look up. Would this man's eyes have seen something where theirs had been blind? He spoke impulsively: ""I wish you'd been there, sir, to go over the house!"" ""I wish I had,"" said Sir James quietly. He sat for a moment in silence. Then he looked up. ""And since then? What have you been doing?"" For a moment, Tommy stared at him. Then it dawned on him that of course the lawyer did not know. ""I forgot that you didn't know about Tuppence,"" he said slowly. The sickening anxiety, forgotten for a while in the excitement of knowing Jane Finn was found at last, swept over him again. The lawyer laid down his knife and fork sharply.

There's nothing to be ashamed of; it's a matter of mutual accommodation, nothing more. Husband on one side, wife on the other. That's my view of the matter, Mr. Pickwick.' 'It is a very philosophical one,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'But breakfast is waiting, Mr. Magnus. Come.' Down they sat to breakfast, but it was evident, notwithstanding the boasting of Mr. Peter Magnus, that he laboured under a very considerable degree of nervousness, of which loss of appetite, a propensity to upset the tea-things, a spectral attempt at drollery, and an irresistible inclination to look at the clock, every other second, were among the principal symptoms.

'Dear, dear,' exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, who had been evidently roused by his friend's appeal; 'what an annoyance that door is! Who is that?' 'Me, Sir,' replied Sam Weller, putting in his head. 'I can't speak to you just now, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'I am engaged at this moment, Sam.' 'Beg your pardon, Sir,' rejoined Mr. Weller. 'But here's a lady here, Sir, as says she's somethin' wery partickler to disclose.' 'I can't see any lady,' replied Mr. Pickwick, whose mind was filled with visions of Mrs. Bardell. 'I wouldn't make too sure o' that, Sir,' urged Mr. Weller, shaking his head.

'Who is it?' inquired Mr. Pickwick. 'Will you see her, Sir?' asked Mr. Weller, holding the door in his hand as if he had some curious live animal on the other side.

There was little in it but the tender assurance Suzette gave him of their love, and the anxiety of Adeline and herself to know how and where he was. She told him that he was not to feel troubled about them; that they were well, and unhappy only for him; but he must not think they blamed him, or had ever done so. As soon as they were sure they could reach him, she said, they would write to him again. Adeline wrote a few lines with her name, to say that for some days past she had not been quite well; but that she was better and had nothing to wish for but to hear from him. When Pinney came back a second time, he found Northwick with the letter open in his hand. ""Well, sir,"" he said, with the easy respectfulness toward Northwick that had been replacing, ever since he talked with Matt Hilary, the hail-fellow manner he used with most men, and that had now fully established itself, ""You\'ve got some noble scenery about here."" He meant to compliment Northwick on the beauty of the landscape, as people ascribe merit to the inhabitants of a flourishing city.

He had not been asked to Hatboro\' to see them before he started, and with all the will he had to invent comfortable and attractive circumstances for them, he was at a disadvantage for want of material. The most that he could conjecture was that Mr. Hilary\'s family had not broken off their friendly relations with them. He had heard old Hilary criticised for it, and he told Northwick so. ""I guess he\'s been standing by you, Mr. Northwick, as far as he consistently could,"" he said; and Northwick ventured to reply that he expected that. ""It was young Hilary who brought me the letter, and talked the whole thing up with me,"" Pinney added. Northwick had apparently not expected this; but he let no more than the fact appear. He kept silent for a time; then he said, ""And you don\'t know anything about the way they\'re living?"" ""No, I don\'t,"" said Pinney, with final candor.

Hilary felt the peculiar hardships of his position, all the more keenly because he had a conscience that would not permit him to shirk his duty. He had used his influence, the weight of his character and business repute, to control the action of the Board towards Northwick, when the defalcation became known, and now he was doubly bound to respond to the wishes of the directors in proceeding against him. Most of them believed that Northwick was still alive; those who were not sure regarded it as a public duty to have him indicted at any rate, and they all voted that Hilary should make the necessary complaint. Then Hilary had no choice but to obey. Another man in his place might have resigned, but he could not, for he knew that he was finally responsible for Northwick's escape.

""Well, you see, I'd got a sort of tired feeling that I'd never find Jane--and that it was all plumb foolishness anyway.

If that's----"" Julius hastened to interrupt. ""Say now, don't be hasty. I don't mean what you mean. I take it Americans have a higher opinion of morality than you have even. What I meant was that the French set about marriage in a businesslike way--find two people who are suited to one another, look after the money affairs, and see the whole thing practically, and in a businesslike spirit.""

Madame de Bellegarde closed her eyes and gave a little cough, which, as a piece of dissimulation, struck Newman as really heroic. ""Dear mother,"" said the marquis, ""does this stuff amuse you so much?"" ""The rest is more amusing,"" said Newman. ""You had better not lose it."" Madame de Bellegarde opened her eyes; the scintillations had gone out of them; they were fixed and dead. But she smiled superbly with her narrow little lips, and repeated Newman\'s word. ""Amusing? Have I killed some one else?"" ""I don\'t count your daughter,"" said Newman, ""though I might! Your husband knew what you were doing. I have a proof of it whose existence you have never suspected."" And he turned to the marquis, who was terribly white--whiter than Newman had ever seen any one out of a picture. ""A paper written by the hand, and signed with the name, of Henri-Urbain de Bellegarde. Written after you, madame, had left him for dead, and while you, sir, had gone--not very fast--for the doctor."" The marquis looked at his mother; she turned away, looking vaguely round her. ""I must sit down,"" she said in a low tone, going toward the bench on which Newman had been sitting. ""Couldn\'t you have spoken to me alone?"" said the marquis to Newman, with a strange look. ""Well, yes, if I could have been sure of speaking to your mother alone, too,"" Newman answered. ""But I have had to take you as I could get you."" Madame de', 'man?"" he asked, eying him askance. ""Well, I hope so,"" said Newman. ""I rather suspect so. In that case, come again."" ""Ah, what an invitation!"" murmured Madame de Cintre, with something painful in her smile. ""Oh, I want Mr. Newman to come--particularly,"" said the young man. ""It will give me great pleasure. I shall be desolate if I miss one of his visits. But I maintain he must be brave. A stout heart, sir!"" And he offered Newman his hand. ""I shall not come to see you; I shall come to see Madame de Cintre,"" said Newman. ""You will need all the more courage."" ""Ah, Valentin!"" said Madame de Cintre, appealingly. ""Decidedly,"" cried Madame de Bellegarde, ""I am the only person here capable of saying something polite! Come to see me; you will need no courage,"" she said. Newman gave a laugh which was not altogether an assent, and took his leave. Madame de Cintre did not take up her sister\'s challenge to be gracious, but she looked with a certain troubled air at the retreating guest. CHAPTER VII One evening very late, about a week after his visit to Madame de Cintre, Newman\'s servant brought him a card. It was that of young M. de Bellegarde. When, a few moments later, he went to receive his visitor, he found him standing in the middle of his great gilded parlor and eying it from cornice to carpet. M. de Bellegarde\'s face, it seemed to Newman, expressed a sense of lively', 'like him,"" said Newman, genially. ""He amuses you, eh?"" ""Yes, perfectly."" ""Do you hear that, Valentin?"" said Madame de Bellegarde. ""You amuse Mr. Newman."" ""Perhaps we shall all come to that!"" Valentin exclaimed. ""You must see my other son,"" said Madame de Bellegarde. ""He is much better than this one. But he will not amuse you."" ""I don\'t know--I don\'t know!"" murmured Valentin, reflectively. ""But we shall very soon see. Here comes Monsieur mon frere."" The door had just opened to give ingress to a gentleman who stepped forward and whose face Newman remembered. He had been the author of our hero\'s discomfiture the first time he tried to present himself to Madame de Cintre. Valentin de Bellegarde went to meet his brother, looked at him a moment, and then, taking him by the arm, led him up to Newman. ""This is my excellent friend Mr. Newman,"" he said very blandly. ""You must know him."" ""I am delighted to know Mr. Newman,"" said the marquis with a low bow, but without offering his hand. ""He is the old woman at second-hand,"" Newman said to himself, as he returned M. de Bellegarde\'s greeting. And this was the starting-point of a speculative theory, in his mind, that the late marquis had been a very amiable foreigner, with an inclination to take life easily and a sense that it was difficult for the husband of the stilted little lady by the fire to do so.

""I feel heated,"" said Tommy. Julius looked at him and judged it wise to say no more. However, Tommy had plenty of time to cool down before they reached Holyhead, and the cheerful grin had returned to his countenance as they alighted at their destination. After consultation, and with the aid of a road map, they were fairly well agreed as to direction, so were able to hire a taxi without more ado and drive out on the road leading to Treaddur Bay. They instructed the man to go slowly, and watched narrowly so as not to miss the path. They came to it not long after leaving the town, and Tommy stopped the car promptly, asked in a casual tone whether the path led down to the sea, and hearing it did paid off the man in handsome style. A moment later the taxi was slowly chugging back to Holyhead. Tommy and Julius watched it out of sight, and then turned to the narrow path. ""It's the right one, I suppose?"" asked Tommy doubtfully. ""There must be simply heaps along here."" ""Sure it is. Look at the gorse. Remember what Jane said?"" Tommy looked at the swelling hedges of golden blossom which bordered the path on either side, and was convinced. They went down in single file, Julius leading.

""He went back to his own home not long ago,--in Poland, I think,"" said Madame Goesler. ""Perhaps he got the instrument there, and brought it with him."" Mr. Low shook his head. ""Of course we are very ignorant;--but it would be a pity that everything should not be tried."" ""He might have got in and out of the window, you know,"" said the Duchess. Still Mr. Low shook his head. ""I believe things can always be found out, if only you take trouble enough. And trouble means money;--does it not?

Now, do you think that the people who will come here to see it will get pleasure enough from it to amount in all to a thousand dollars a day?"" ""I don\'t know,"" said Rollo, doubtfully. ""I\'d give one dollar, I know, to see it."" ""Yes,"" said Mr. George, ""so would I; and I do not know but that there would be three hundred thousand to come in a year, including all the great occasions that would bring out immense assemblages from all the surrounding country."" ""At any rate, I hope they will finish it,"" said Rollo. ""So do I,"" said Mr. George. ""And I mean to put a little in the man\'s plate when I go down,"" said Rollo, ""and then I shall have a share in it."" ""I will too,"" said Mr. George. Accordingly, as they passed by the man when they were leaving the church, Mr. George put a franc into his plate, and Rollo half a franc.

""Can't be,"" said Julius positively. ""We'd see him."" Tommy had to admit that this was true. Nevertheless, his sense of uneasiness deepened. In spite of himself he believed in the omniscience of the enemy. ""I rather wish that fellow would come along,"" said Julius. He patted his pocket. ""Little William here is just aching for exercise!"" ""Do you always carry it--him--with you?"" inquired Tommy with burning curiosity. ""Most always. I guess you never know what might turn up."" Tommy kept a respectful silence. He was impressed by little William. It seemed to remove the menace of Mr. Brown farther away. The path was now running along the side of the cliff, parallel to the sea. Suddenly Julius came to such an abrupt halt that Tommy cannoned into him. ""What's up?"" he inquired. ""Look there.

He had already thought of going straight to Mr. Granger, but had abandoned the idea as hopeless. Who would believe this tale of sleep-walking?

The silence was horrible; the solitude of the lonely corridor was a solitude of invisible treacheries. He began to count to keep his mind employed--to keep his own growing dread away from him.

The duty was an unpleasant one, but Tommy had no intention of shirking it. He must report his failure to Mr. Carter. After that his work was done. He took the midnight mail to London.

Mr. Carter eyed him sharply. ""You mean that the treaty----"" ""Is in the hands of Mr. Brown, sir."" ""Ah!"" said Mr. Carter quietly. The expression on his face did not change, but Tommy caught the flicker of despair in his eyes. It convinced him as nothing else had done that the outlook was hopeless.

The adjutant told me that he has specially chosen him for you, because he had a particularly good mount, and that as your orderly it would be of great importance that he should be able to keep up with you. Of course, he got the horse when he was the colonel\'s orderly; and though he was sent back to the ranks six months ago, the colonel, who was really fond of the man, allowed him to keep it.""

A new fear gripped at his heart. ""Is there--something more, sir?"" ""I'm afraid so,"" said Mr. Carter gravely. He stretched out his hand to a sheet on the table. ""Tuppence----?"" faltered Tommy. ""Read for yourself."" The typewritten words danced before his eyes. The description of a green toque, a coat with a handkerchief in the pocket marked P.L.C.

'I believe it is, Sir,' said Mr. Peter Magnus. 'I am very confident, Sir. Really, Mr. Pickwick, I do not see why a man should feel any fear in such a case as this, sir. What is it, Sir? There's nothing to be ashamed of; it's a matter of mutual accommodation, nothing more. Husband on one side, wife on the other. That's my view of the matter, Mr. Pickwick.' 'It is a very philosophical one,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'But breakfast is waiting, Mr. Magnus. Come.' Down they sat to breakfast, but it was evident, notwithstanding the boasting of Mr. Peter Magnus, that he laboured under a very considerable degree of nervousness, of which loss of appetite, a propensity to upset the tea-things, a spectral attempt at drollery, and an irresistible inclination to look at the clock, every other second, were among the principal symptoms. 'He-he-he,'tittered Mr. Magnus, affecting cheerfulness, and gasping with agitation. 'It only wants two minutes, Mr. Pickwick. Am I pale, Sir?' 'Not very,' replied Mr. Pickwick. There was a brief pause. 'I beg your pardon, Mr. Pickwick; but have you ever done this sort of thing in your time?' said Mr. Magnus. 'You mean proposing?' said Mr. Pickwick. 'Yes.'

'Dear, dear,' exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, who had been evidently roused by his friend's appeal; 'what an annoyance that door is! Who is that?' 'Me, Sir,' replied Sam Weller, putting in his head. 'I can't speak to you just now, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'I am engaged at this moment, Sam.' 'Beg your pardon, Sir,' rejoined Mr. Weller. 'But here's a lady here, Sir, as says she's somethin' wery partickler to disclose.' 'I can't see any lady,' replied Mr. Pickwick, whose mind was filled with visions of Mrs. Bardell. 'I wouldn't make too sure o' that, Sir,' urged Mr. Weller, shaking his head. 'If you know'd who was near, sir, I rayther think you'd change your note; as the hawk remarked to himself vith a cheerful laugh, ven he heerd the robin-redbreast a-singin' round the corner.' 'Who is it?' inquired Mr. Pickwick. 'Will you see her, Sir?' asked Mr. Weller, holding the door in his hand as if he had some curious live animal on the other side.

'The wall is very low, sir, and your servant will give you a leg up.' 'My servant will give me a leg up,' repeated Mr. Pickwick mechanically.

Thus, for the second time, did Mr. Pickwick's innate good-feeling involve him in an enterprise from which he would most willingly have stood aloof. 'What is the name of the house?' inquired Mr. Pickwick. 'Westgate House, Sir.

""I think we had better arrange matters, Dick,"" said Mr. Rover, with a sigh. ""I am tired of fighting. If they will do the fair thing all around, let them go."" ""Just as you say, Father,"" replied Dick. ""But they must give up everything that belongs to us."" ""Well, you can see to it that they do-- you and Mr. Powell,"" answered Anderson Rover. ""I am going back to the farm to rest, and after that I think I\'ll travel a little for my health."" ""All right, Dad. But-- but----"" Dick stammered and grew red. ""You-- er-- you won\'t go away until after my wedding, will you?"" ""No, Dick, I\'ll stay home until after you and Dora are married,"" answered Mr. Rover, with a quiet smile. CHAPTER XXX MRS. DICK ROVER-- CONCLUSION ""The day of days, Dick!"" ""Right you are, Sam! And what a perfect day it is!"" ""Oh, I had this weather made to order,"" came from Tom Rover, with a grin. ""How do you feel, Tom?"" questioned his big brother kindly, as he turned away from the window to look at the lad who had been hurt. ""Oh, I\'m as chipper as a catbird with two tails!"" sang out the fun-loving Rover. But his pale face was not in keeping with his words. Tom was not yet himself. But be wasn\'t going to show it-- especially on', 'that message from Richard Rover?"" ""If you please."" ""He says he is coming up to Ashton on the train that gets here at eleven-fifteen tonight."" ""Is that all?"" ""Yes."" ""Very well. Thank you,"" and Sam hung up the receiver. ""What\'s the news, Sam?"" questioned Songbird, and when told he looked relieved. ""Dick will know what to do."" ""I know what I am going to do, Songbird. I am going right back to Brill and get ready to follow Tom."" ""I supposed you\'d do that. I\'d like to go with you."" ""I know it. But that won\'t be necessary--if Dick goes with me."" Sam drew a deep breath. ""I--I guess I\'d better stop at Hope on the way back and let the girls know how matters stand,"" he added, soberly. ""I can go up to-morrow and tell them, Sam."" ""No. I\'d rather tell them myself,"" answered the youngest Rover. He knew exactly how Nellie and Grace would feel when he broke the news to them. It was a very sober and thoughtful pair of boys that got in the carriage and started back to Brill by the way of Hope Seminary. Sam was laying his plans how to follow Tom in his wild trip West and Songbird was wondering how he could be of assistance to the Rovers. Several times the would-be poet started to quote some original verse, but each time cut himself short.

He went across to the writing-table. With the usual perversity of bedroom stationery, there were innumerable envelopes and no paper. He rang. No one came. Tommy fumed at the delay. Then he remembered that there was a good supply in Julius's sitting-room. The American had announced his immediate departure, there would be no fear of running up against him. Besides, he wouldn't mind if he did. He was beginning to be rather ashamed of the things he had said. Old Julius had taken them jolly well. He'd apologize if he found him there. But the room was deserted. Tommy walked across to the writing-table, and opened the middle drawer. A photograph, carelessly thrust in face upwards, caught his eye. For a moment he stood rooted to the ground. Then he took it out, shut the drawer, walked slowly over to an arm-chair, and sat down still staring at the photograph in his hand. What on earth was a photograph of the French girl Annette doing in Julius Hersheimmer's writing-table? CHAPTER XXII. IN DOWNING STREET THE Prime Minister tapped the desk in front of him with nervous fingers. His face was worn and harassed. He took up his conversation with Mr. Carter at the point it had broken off.

We shall do very well when Theodora comes; and if she has a taste for the boy, she and Violet will make friends over him,--good night.\' With a long yawn, Arthur very stiffly walked up-stairs, where Sarah stood at the top waiting for him. \'Mrs. Martindale is asleep, sir; you had best not go', ""is it?'

Then, perhaps taking Violet's bewildered looks for reluctance, 'I am afraid, my dear, I have not always been as affectionate as you deserved, and have not always tried to make you comfortable.' 'Oh! no, no! Don't say so!' 'It was before I rightly knew you; and indeed it shall never be so again. We are so comfortable now together; do not let us break it up again, and take the poor dear children away to grow pale in London.

""DEAR MR. CARTER, ""Something's turned up that has given me a jar. Of course I may be simply making an awful ass of myself, but I don't think so. If my conclusions are right, that girl at Manchester was just a plant.

""I think I know who the real Jane Finn is, and I've even got an idea where the papers are. That last's only a guess, of course, but I've a sort of feeling it'll turn out right. Anyhow, I enclose it in a sealed envelope for what it's worth. I'm going to ask you not to open it until the very last moment, midnight on the 28th, in fact. You'll understand why in a minute. You see, I've figured it out that those things of Tuppence's are a plant too, and she's no more drowned than I am. The way I reason is this: as a last chance they'll let Jane Finn escape in the hope that she's been shamming this memory stunt, and that once she thinks she's free she'll go right away to the cache.

Blanche looked round at the sleeping Geoffrey. ""And _he_ knows!"" she said. ""It\'s maddening, uncle, to look at the brute snoring in his chair!"" Sir Patrick held up a warning hand. Before a word more could be said between them they were silenced again by another interruption. The whist-party comprised Lady Lundie and the surgeon, playing as partners against Smith and Jones. Arnold sat behind the surgeon, taking a lesson in the game. One, Two, and Three, thus left to their own devices, naturally thought of the billiard-table; and, detecting Geoffrey asleep in his corner, advanced to disturb his slumbers, under the all-sufficing apology of ""Pool."" Geoffrey roused himself, and rubbed his eyes, and said, drowsily, ""All right."" As he rose, he looked at the opposite corner in which Sir Patrick and his niece were sitting. Blanche\'s self-possession, resolutely as she struggled to preserve it, was not strong enough to keep her eyes from turning toward Geoffrey with an expression which betrayed the reluctant interest that she now felt in him. He stopped, noticing something entirely new in the look with which the young lady was regarding him. ""Beg your pardon,"" said Geoffrey. ""Do you wish to speak to me?"" Blanche\'s face flushed all over. Her uncle came to the rescue. ""Miss Lundie and I hope you have slept well Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick, jocosely. ""That\'s all."" ""Oh? That\'s all?"" said Geoffrey still', 'looked like himself again. ""Why go indoors this lovely weather?"" he said. ""Suppose we take a turn in the garden?"" Blanche pressed Anne\'s hand significantly. The proposal was evidently made for a purpose. They turned the corner of the cottage and gained the large garden at the back--the two ladies walking together, arm in arm; Sir Patrick and Geoffrey following them. Little by little, Blanche quickened her pace. ""I have got my instructions,"" she whispered to Anne. ""Let\'s get out of his hearing."" It was more easily said than done. Geoffrey kept close behind them. ""Consider my lameness, Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick. ""Not quite so fast."" It was well intended. But Geoffrey\'s cunning had taken the alarm. Instead of dropping behind with Sir Patrick, he called to his wife. ""Consider Sir Patrick\'s lameness,"" he repeated. ""Not quite so fast."" Sir Patrick met that check with characteristic readiness. When Anne slackened her pace, he addressed himself to Geoffrey, stopping deliberately in the middle of the path. ""Let me give you my message from Holchester House,"" he said. The two ladies were still slowly walking on. Geoffrey was placed between the alternatives of staying with Sir Patrick and leaving them by themselves--or of following them and leaving Sir Patrick. Deliberately, on his side, he followed the ladies. Sir Patrick called him back. ""I told you I wished to speak to you,"" he said, sharply. Driven to bay, Geoffrey openly revealed his resolution to give Blanche no opportunity of speaking in private', 'look at Anne. The look was not returned--was not even seen. From the moment when she had taken her place by Sir Patrick, Anne\'s eyes had rested on Blanche. They never moved--they never for an instant lost their tender sadness--when the woman who hated her spoke. All that was beautiful and true in that noble nature seemed to find its one sufficient encouragement in Blanche. As she looked once more at the sister of the unforgotten days of old, its native beauty of expression shone out again in her worn and weary face. Every man in the room (but Geoffrey) looked at her; and every man (but Geoffrey) felt for her. Sir Patrick addressed a second question to his sister-in-law. ""Is there any one here to represent the interests of Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn?"" he asked. Lady Lundie referred Sir Patrick to Geoffrey himself. Without looking up, Geoffrey motioned with his big brown hand to Mr. Moy, sitting by his side. Mr. Moy (holding the legal rank in Scotland which corresponds to the rank held by solicitors in England) rose and bowed to Sir Patrick, with the courtesy due to a man eminent in his time at the Scottish Bar. ""I represent Mr. Delamayn,"" he said. ""I congratulate myself, Sir Patrick, on having your ability and experience to appeal to in the conduct of the pending inquiry.""

'Wery well, sir,' replied Mr. Weller. 'I don't like this plan,' said Mr. Pickwick, after deep meditation. 'Why cannot I communicate with the young lady's friends?' 'Because they live one hundred miles from here, sir,' responded Job Trotter. 'That's a clincher,' said Mr. Weller, aside. 'Then this garden,' resumed Mr. Pickwick. 'How am I to get into it?' 'The wall is very low, sir, and your servant will give you a leg up.' 'My servant will give me a leg up,' repeated Mr. Pickwick mechanically.

Thus, for the second time, did Mr. Pickwick's innate good-feeling involve him in an enterprise from which he would most willingly have stood aloof. 'What is the name of the house?' inquired Mr. Pickwick. 'Westgate House, Sir.

The original of that photograph was the French girl, Annette, who saved his life."" ""What?"" ""Exactly. I asked the young man with some curiosity what he had done with the photograph. He replied that he had put it back where he found it."" The lawyer paused again. ""That was good, you know--distinctly good. He can use his brains, that young fellow. I congratulated him. The discovery was a providential one. Of course, from the moment that the girl in Manchester was proved to be a plant everything was altered. Young Beresford saw that for himself without my having to tell it him. But he felt he couldn't trust his judgment on the subject of Miss Cowley. Did I think she was alive? I told him, duly weighing the evidence, that there was a very decided chance in favour of it. That brought us back to the telegram."" ""Yes?"" ""I advised him to apply to you for a copy of the original wire. It had occurred to me as probable that, after Miss Cowley flung it on the floor, certain words might have been erased and altered with the express intention of setting searchers on a false trail.""

There was little in it but the tender assurance Suzette gave him of their love, and the anxiety of Adeline and herself to know how and where he was. She told him that he was not to feel troubled about them; that they were well, and unhappy only for him; but he must not think they blamed him, or had ever done so. As soon as they were sure they could reach him, she said, they would write to him again. Adeline wrote a few lines with her name, to say that for some days past she had not been quite well; but that she was better and had nothing to wish for but to hear from him. When Pinney came back a second time, he found Northwick with the letter open in his hand. ""Well, sir,"" he said, with the easy respectfulness toward Northwick that had been replacing, ever since he talked with Matt Hilary, the hail-fellow manner he used with most men, and that had now fully established itself, ""You\'ve got some noble scenery about here."" He meant to compliment Northwick on the beauty of the landscape, as people ascribe merit to the inhabitants of a flourishing city. Northwick, by his silence, neither accepted nor disclaimed the credit of the local picturesqueness; and Pinney ventured to add, ""But you seem to take it out in nature, Mr. Northwick. The place is pretty quiet, sir."" Northwick paid no heed to this observation, either;', 'than that they were well, and anxious to hear from him; and Pinney really knew nothing more about them. He had not been asked to Hatboro\' to see them before he started, and with all the will he had to invent comfortable and attractive circumstances for them, he was at a disadvantage for want of material. The most that he could conjecture was that Mr. Hilary\'s family had not broken off their friendly relations with them. He had heard old Hilary criticised for it, and he told Northwick so. ""I guess he\'s been standing by you, Mr. Northwick, as far as he consistently could,"" he said; and Northwick ventured to reply that he expected that. ""It was young Hilary who brought me the letter, and talked the whole thing up with me,"" Pinney added. Northwick had apparently not expected this; but he let no more than the fact appear. He kept silent for a time; then he said, ""And you don\'t know anything about the way they\'re living?"" ""No, I don\'t,"" said Pinney, with final candor. ""But I should say they were living along there about as usual. Mr. Hilary didn\'t say but what they were. I guess you haven\'t got any cause to be uneasy on that score. My idea is, Mr. Northwick, that they wanted to leave you just as free as they could about themselves. They wanted to find out your whereabouts in the land of the living, first of all.

Hilary felt the peculiar hardships of his position, all the more keenly because he had a conscience that would not permit him to shirk his duty. He had used his influence, the weight of his character and business repute, to control the action of the Board towards Northwick, when the defalcation became known, and now he was doubly bound to respond to the wishes of the directors in proceeding against him. Most of them believed that Northwick was still alive; those who were not sure regarded it as a public duty to have him indicted at any rate, and they all voted that Hilary should make the necessary complaint. Then Hilary had no choice but to obey. Another man in his place might have resigned, but he could not, for he knew that he was finally responsible for Northwick's escape. He made it no less his duty to find out just how much hardship it would work Northwick's daughters, and he tried to lend them money. But Suzette answered for both that her father had left them some money when he went away; and Hilary could only send Louise to explain how he must formally appear in the legal proceedings; he allowed Louise to put whatever warmth of color she wished into his regrets and into his advice that they should consult a lawyer.

At length the judge took his seat, and the clerk of the crown sat beneath him ready to record the decision of the jury. A few lighted candles were stuck about in different parts of the court; but they were lost in the obscurity of the large, dark, dismal building. The foreman stood ready with a written and signed paper. The judge asked him if they had all come to a unanimous verdict, and he answered in the affirmative; and handed the paper to the clerk of the peace, who glancing his eye upon it, and half turning round to the judge said in his peculiar, sonorous voice-- ""My lord, the prisoner has been found guilty."" ""Gentlemen, is that your verdict?"" said the judge; and they said it was. The prisoner stood up at the bar erect without moving. He neither shook nor trembled now. If it were not that his lips were pressed quite close together, he would have appeared to have heard the verdict without emotion. Not so Father John; he had been leaning back, anxiously waiting till the one fatal word met his ear; and then his head fell forward on the desk, and he sobbed like a woman. Baron Hamilton immediately placed the black cap on his head, and proceeded to pronounce the dreadful sentence of death. As he did so, his voice seemed like some awful, measured tone proceeding from an immovable figure', 'of the jury with any further defence, he replied: “No, sir; I leave it for your honor to charge; I rest my case here.” “Mr. District Attorney,” said the Judge, “have you anything to say?” Mr. Van der School removed his spectacles, folded them and, replacing them once more on his nose, eyed the other bill which he held in his hand, and then said, looking at the bar over the top of his glasses; I shall rest the prosecution here, if the court please.” Judge Temple arose and began the charge. “Gentlemen of the jury,” he said, “you have heard the testimony, and I shall detain you but a moment. If an officer meet with resistance in the execution of a process, he has an undoubted right to call any citizen to his assistance; and the acts of such assistant come within the protection of the law. I shall leave you to judge, gentlemen, from the testimony, how far the witness in this prosecution can be so considered, feeling less reluctance to submit the case thus informally to your decision, because there is yet another indictment to be tried, which involves heavier charges against the unfortunate prisoner.” The tone of Marmaduke was mild and insinuating, and, as his sentiments were given with such apparent impartiality, they did not fail of carrying due weight with the jury. The grave-looking yeomen who composed this tribunal laid their heads together for a few minutes, without leaving the box, when the foreman arose,', 'they had to decide whether he had, in accordance with the theory of the prosecution, carried that threat into effect; or whether on the other hand, as the defense suggested, the deceased had fallen a victim to the agent of the association which had threatened his life. He was bound to tell them that if they entertained any doubt as to the guilt of the prisoner at the bar they were bound to give him the benefit of the doubt. The jury consulted together for a short time and then expressed their desire to retire to consider their verdict. They were absent about half an hour and on their return the foreman said in reply to the question of the judge that they found the prisoner ""Not Guilty."" A perfect silence reigned in the court when the jury entered the box, and something like a sigh of relief followed their verdict. It was expected, and indeed there was some surprise when the jury retired, for the general opinion was that whether guilty or innocent the prosecution had failed to bring home unmistakably the crime to the prisoner. That he might have committed it was certain, that he had committed it was probable, but it was assuredly not proved that he and none other had been the perpetrator of the crime.

A RACE AGAINST TIME AFTER ringing up Sir James, Tommy's next procedure was to make a call at South Audley Mansions. He found Albert discharging his professional duties, and introduced himself without more ado as a friend of Tuppence's. Albert unbent immediately.

By the way, have you by any chance an aunt, a cousin, a grandmother, or any other suitable female relation who might be represented as being likely to kick the bucket?"" A delighted grin spread slowly over Albert's countenance. ""I'm on, sir. My poor aunt what lives in the country has been mortal bad for a long time, and she's asking for me with her dying breath.""

We will get Mr. Audley to talk to him, you know, and we will say a prayer every day for him.' Lance, beginning to recover, put his arms round Cherry's neck, gave her a tremendous hug, released himself from his brother's arms, and ran off to bed. Felix remained a few moments, while Cherry exclaimed, 'Oh! the dear good little fellow!' 'Better than any of us,' said Felix. 'I was quite savage with Mr. Audley when I found out about it. I must go down and tell him. I never thought all that was in the little chap! I'm glad he came to you, Cherry. Good-night.' 'And you will try to teach this poor boy, Felix?' 'I don't say that. I don't in the least know how; but I shall not dare to hinder Lance, now I see how he goes on.' On his way down he heard voices in the sitting-room, where, in fact, Mr. Audley had joined Wilmet, to explain to her how vexed he was to have so much annoyed Felix, and perhaps also something of his own annoyance at the manner in which Felix took it. Wilmet, partly from her 'growing on the sunny side of the wall,' partly from her early authority, was in some ways older than her brother, and could see that there was in him a shade of boyish jealousy of his prerogative; and as she sat, in her"", ""she said little of her fears, knowing the importance of Wilmet's having and enjoying her holiday; and Mr. Audley promised extra aid in keeping order among the boys. But as they came in that evening from the practice at the church, to which Clement had insisted on their coming to hear Lance, Mr. Audley beckoned Felix to his room with the words, 'There's a thing I want to talk over with you.' Felix recollected those ominous words to Mr. Underwood, and stood warming his hands in dread of what might be coming. It was all he feared. 'I wanted to say--I wanted to tell you--' began Mr. Audley. 'I would not have chosen this time, but that I think it may save Wilmet something to be able to tell her friends that the present arrangement is to cease.' 'Wilmet!' exclaimed Felix; then bethinking himself. 'Was _that_ what Tom Underwood meant? But you will not trouble yourself about such rubbish.' 'Well, you see,' began the Curate, with heightening colour, 'it can't be denied that your sister _has_ grown up, and that things are changed.' 'Mrs. Froggatt _did_ ask me if you were going on here,' said Felix, still unconvinced; 'but can't we leave people to be _stoopid_ without interfering with us?' 'Felix, you ought to be a better protector to your sisters. You would not like to have my Lady remonstrating--nay, maybe writing to my mother: she is quite capable of it.' Felix's cheeks were in a flame. 'If people would"", ""'Little Cherry is the cleverest of us all,' added Felix. 'Still,' said the Sister, 'the mere going over your work with you will give her change and interest. I do feel strongly convinced; dear Wilmet, that to shut yourself up with her, without gathering anything from elsewhere, would be very bad for both.' 'We must see how Mamma is, and how Cherry gets on,' was all that Wilmet would say, but the arrangement was made, and was to take effect in ten days' time, when Mr. Mowbray Smith was coming to be second curate, and Sister Constance must change places with the three absent children, and Alda would be gone to her adopted home. Then Mr. Audley took leave; and as Felix went to the front door with him, he said, 'Forgive me, Felix; but I am a younger brother myself, and I do hope you do not mean to assert your authority by licking.' Felix coloured a little; and though he spoke respectfully, it was with some little annoyance. 'There is nothing else that does with Fulbert.'

To Albert fell the task of collecting information. There was no difficulty about it. Astley Priors was the property of a Dr. Adams. The doctor no longer practiced, had retired, the landlord believed, but he took a few private patients--here the good fellow tapped his forehead knowingly--""balmy ones! You understand!"" The doctor was a popular figure in the village, subscribed freely to all the local sports--""a very pleasant, affable gentleman."" Been there long? Oh, a matter of ten years or so--might be longer. Scientific gentleman, he was. Professors and people often came down from town to see him. Anyway, it was a gay house, always visitors. In the face of all this volubility, Tommy felt doubts. Was it possible that this genial, well-known figure could be in reality a dangerous criminal? His life seemed so open and aboveboard. No hint of sinister doings. Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake? Tommy felt a cold chill at the thought. Then he remembered the private patients--""balmy ones."" He inquired carefully if there was a young lady amongst them, describing Tuppence. But nothing much seemed to be known about the patients--they were seldom seen outside the grounds. A guarded description of Annette also failed to provoke recognition.

Luckily the messenger who was sent to fetch a doctor, seeing Mr. Curtis and me walking up the street, ran up to us and said that a young officer of our ship was hurt, and that he was sent in to fetch a doctor. He had, in fact, already seen one, and was in the act of returning with him when he met us. Of course I introduced myself to the French doctor as we came along together, for we fortunately got hold of a trap directly, so that no time was lost.

The doctor was obliged to acknowledge that there did seem to be some improvement. ""And now, doctor, how about money? Eh?"" Doctor Thorne, like other guardians similarly circumstanced, began to explain that Sir Louis had already had a good deal of money, and had begun also to promise that more should be forthcoming in the event of good behaviour, when he was somewhat suddenly interrupted by Sir Louis. ""Well, now; I\'ll tell you what, doctor; I\'ve got a bit of news for you; something that I think will astonish you."" The doctor opened his eyes, and tried to look as though ready to be', 'a bad pain."" ""Where is it?"" ""Here."" ""Stand up,"" says the doctor, ""and put your arms up above your head."" Then the doctor goes behind the patient and strikes him a powerful blow in the back. ""Do you feel that,"" he says. ""I do,"" says the patient. Then the doctor turns suddenly and lets him have a left hook under the heart. ""Can you feel that,"" he says viciously, as the patient falls over on the sofa in a heap. ""Get up,"" says the doctor, and counts ten. The patient rises. The doctor looks him over very carefully without speaking, and then suddenly fetches him a blow in the stomach that doubles him up speechless. The doctor walks over to the window and reads the morning paper for a while. Presently he turns and begins to mutter more to himself than the patient.

Owing to Albert's insistence they dragged themselves along painfully on their stomachs, thereby producing a great deal more noise than if they had stood upright. In any case, these precautions were totally unnecessary. The grounds, like those of any other private house after nightfall, seemed untenanted. Tommy had imagined a possible fierce watchdog. Albert's fancy ran to a puma, or a tame cobra. But they reached a shrubbery near the house quite unmolested. The blinds of the dining-room window were up. There was a large company assembled round the table. The port was passing from hand to hand. It seemed a normal, pleasant company. Through the open window scraps of conversation floated out disjointedly on the night air. It was a heated discussion on county cricket! Again Tommy felt that cold chill of uncertainty. It seemed impossible to believe that these people were other than they seemed. Had he been fooled once more? The fair-bearded, spectacled gentleman who sat at the head of the table looked singularly honest and normal. Tommy slept badly that night. The following morning the indefatigable Albert, having cemented an alliance with the greengrocer's boy, took the latter's place and ingratiated himself with the cook at Malthouse. He returned with the information that she was undoubtedly ""one of the crooks,"" but Tommy mistrusted the vividness of his imagination.

Merciful powers! he had been seen--the old man was coming in. What could he say? Tell the truth, that was all; but who would believe such a story? why, it was one that he should scarcely care to advance in a court of law. Could he expect a father to believe it--a father finding a man crouched like a thief behind a door at the dead of night with his lovely daughter senseless in his arms? He had already thought of going straight to Mr. Granger, but had abandoned the idea as hopeless. Who would believe this tale of sleep-walking? For the first time in his life Geoffrey felt terribly afraid, both for Beatrice and himself; the hair rose on his head, his heart stood still, and a cold perspiration started on to his face.

A terror that was slow and cold and deadly crept into his hands, and guided them in the dark to the key that had been left for him in the inner side of the door. He turned it in vague distrust of what might happen next, and waited. The slow minutes passed, and nothing happened. The silence was horrible; the solitude of the lonely corridor was a solitude of invisible treacheries. He began to count to keep his mind employed--to keep his own growing dread away from him.

The substitution being repeated (much to the pecuniary advantage of the real greengrocer's boy) on the following day, Albert brought back the first piece of hopeful news. There WAS a French young lady staying in the house. Tommy put his doubts aside. Here was confirmation of his theory. But time pressed. To-day was the 27th. The 29th was the much-talked-of ""Labour Day,"" about which all sorts of rumours were running riot. Newspapers were getting agitated. Sensational hints of a Labour coup d'etat were freely reported. The Government said nothing. It knew and was prepared. There were rumours of dissension among the Labour leaders. They were not of one mind. The more far-seeing among them realized that what they proposed might well be a death-blow to the England that at heart they loved. They shrank from the starvation and misery a general strike would entail, and were willing to meet the Government half-way. But behind them were subtle, insistent forces at work, urging the memories of old wrongs, deprecating the weakness of half-and-half measures, fomenting misunderstandings. Tommy felt that, thanks to Mr. Carter, he understood the position fairly accurately. With the fatal document in the hands of Mr. Brown, public opinion would swing to the side of the Labour extremists and revolutionists. Failing that, the battle was an even chance.

""The people I\'d most come back for are the people you know. I\'d do it for Mrs. Lowder, who has been beautifully kind to me."" ""So she has to _me_,"" said Densher. ""I feel,"" he added as she at first answered nothing, ""that, quite contrary to anything I originally expected, I\'ve made a good friend of her."" ""I didn\'t expect it either--its turning out as it has. But I did,"" said Milly, ""with Kate. I shall come back for her too. I\'d do anything""--she kept it up--""for Kate."" Looking at him as with conscious clearness while she spoke, she might for the moment have effectively laid a trap for whatever remains of the ideal straightness in him were still able to pull themselves together and operate. He was afterwards to say to himself that something had at that moment hung for him by a hair. ""Oh I know what one would do for Kate!""--it had hung for him by a hair to break out with that, which he felt he had really been kept from by an element in his consciousness stronger still. The proof of the truth in question was precisely in his silence; resisting the impulse to break out was what he was doing for Kate. This at the time moreover came and went quickly enough; he was trying the next minute but to make Milly\'s allusion easy for herself. ""Of course I know what friends you are--and of course I understand,"" he permitted himself to', 'was they, all of them together, who had developed her. She was always a charmer, one of the greatest ever seen, but she wasn\'t the person he had ""backed."" Densher was to feel sure afterwards that Kate had had in these pleasantries no conscious, above all no insolent purpose of making light of poor Susan Shepherd\'s property in their young friend--which property, by such remarks, was very much pushed to the wall; but he was also to know that Mrs. Stringham had secretly resented them, Mrs. Stringham holding the opinion, of which he was ultimately to have a glimpse, that all the Kate Croys in Christendom were but dust for the feet of her Milly. That, it was true, would be what she must reveal only when driven to her last entrenchments and well cornered in her passion--the rare passion of friendship, the sole passion of her little life save the one other, more imperturbably cerebral, that she entertained for the art of Guy de Maupassant. She slipped in the observation that her Milly was incapable of change, was just exactly, on the contrary, the same Milly; but this made little difference in the drift of Kate\'s contention. She was perfectly kind to Susie: it was as if she positively knew her as handicapped for any disagreement by feeling that she, Kate, had ""type,"" and by being committed to admiration of type. Kate had occasion subsequently--she found it somehow--to mention to our young man Milly\'s having spoken to her of', 'you, what she makes of the incident, the other day, of Lord Mark\'s so very superficial visit?--his having spent here, as I gather, but the two or three hours necessary for seeing our friend and yet taken no time at all, since he went off by the same night\'s train, for seeing any one else. What can she make of his not having waited to see _you_, or to see herself--with all he owes her?"" ""Oh of course,"" said Kate, ""she understands. He came to make Milly his offer of marriage--he came for nothing but that. As Milly wholly declined it his business was for the time at an end. He couldn\'t quite on the spot turn round to make up to _us_."" Kate had looked surprised that, as a matter of taste on such an adventurer\'s part, Densher shouldn\'t see it. But Densher was lost in another thought. ""Do you mean that when, turning up myself, I found him leaving her, that was what had been taking place between them?"" ""Didn\'t you make it out, my dear?"" Kate enquired. ""What sort of a blundering weathercock then _is_ he?"" the young man went on in his wonder. ""Oh don\'t make too little of him!"" Kate smiled. ""Do you pretend that Milly didn\'t tell you?"" ""How great an ass he had made of himself?"" Kate continued to smile. ""You _are_ in love with her, you know."" He gave her another long look.

With Mr. Brown unmasked and captured he believed, rightly or wrongly, that the whole organization would crumble ignominiously and instantaneously. The strange permeating influence of the unseen chief held it together. Without him, Tommy believed an instant panic would set in; and, the honest men left to themselves, an eleventh-hour reconciliation would be possible. ""This is a one-man show,"" said Tommy to himself. ""The thing to do is to get hold of the man."" It was partly in furtherance of this ambitious design that he had requested Mr. Carter not to open the sealed envelope. The draft treaty was Tommy's bait. Every now and then he was aghast at his own presumption. How dared he think that he had discovered what so many wiser and clever men had overlooked? Nevertheless, he stuck tenaciously to his idea. That evening he and Albert once more penetrated the grounds of Astley Priors. Tommy's ambition was somehow or other to gain admission to the house itself. As they approached cautiously, Tommy gave a sudden gasp. On the second floor window some one standing between the window and the light in the room threw a silhouette on the blind.

It was decided by Mr. Strong that Arnold Baxter should be removed to the camp on a stretcher, and four boys, including Sam and Tom, volunteered for the service.

It had been a favourite on the gramophone in Tuppence's hospital days. He did not doubt but that she would recognize it and draw her own conclusions. Tommy had not a note of music in his voice, but his lungs were excellent. The noise he produced was terrific. Presently an unimpeachable butler, accompanied by an equally unimpeachable footman, issued from the front door. The butler remonstrated with him. Tommy continued to sing, addressing the butler affectionately as ""dear old whiskers."" The footman took him by one arm, the butler by the other. They ran him down the drive, and neatly out of the gate. The butler threatened him with the police if he intruded again. It was beautifully done--soberly and with perfect decorum. Anyone would have sworn that the butler was a real butler, the footman a real footman--only, as it happened, the butler was Whittington! Tommy retired to the inn and waited for Albert's return.

'I believe it is, Sir,' said Mr. Peter Magnus. 'I am very confident, Sir. Really, Mr. Pickwick, I do not see why a man should feel any fear in such a case as this, sir. What is it, Sir? There's nothing to be ashamed of; it's a matter of mutual accommodation, nothing more. Husband on one side, wife on the other. That's my view of the matter, Mr. Pickwick.' 'It is a very philosophical one,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'But breakfast is waiting, Mr. Magnus. Come.' Down they sat to breakfast, but it was evident, notwithstanding the boasting of Mr. Peter Magnus, that he laboured under a very considerable degree of nervousness, of which loss of appetite, a propensity to upset the tea-things, a spectral attempt at drollery, and an irresistible inclination to look at the clock, every other second, were among the principal symptoms. 'He-he-he,'tittered Mr. Magnus, affecting cheerfulness, and gasping with agitation. 'It only wants two minutes, Mr. Pickwick. Am I pale, Sir?' 'Not very,' replied Mr. Pickwick. There was a brief pause. 'I beg your pardon, Mr. Pickwick; but have you ever done this sort of thing in your time?' said Mr. Magnus. 'You mean proposing?' said Mr. Pickwick. 'Yes.'

'Dear, dear,' exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, who had been evidently roused by his friend's appeal; 'what an annoyance that door is! Who is that?' 'Me, Sir,' replied Sam Weller, putting in his head. 'I can't speak to you just now, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'I am engaged at this moment, Sam.' 'Beg your pardon, Sir,' rejoined Mr. Weller. 'But here's a lady here, Sir, as says she's somethin' wery partickler to disclose.' 'I can't see any lady,' replied Mr. Pickwick, whose mind was filled with visions of Mrs. Bardell. 'I wouldn't make too sure o' that, Sir,' urged Mr. Weller, shaking his head.

'Who is it?' inquired Mr. Pickwick. 'Will you see her, Sir?' asked Mr. Weller, holding the door in his hand as if he had some curious live animal on the other side.

'The wall is very low, sir, and your servant will give you a leg up.' 'My servant will give me a leg up,' repeated Mr. Pickwick mechanically.

Thus, for the second time, did Mr. Pickwick's innate good-feeling involve him in an enterprise from which he would most willingly have stood aloof. 'What is the name of the house?' inquired Mr. Pickwick. 'Westgate House, Sir.

Tuppence opened the door of an empty first-class compartment, and the two girls sank down breathless on the padded seats. A man looked in, then passed on to the next carriage. Jane started nervously. Her eyes dilated with terror. She looked questioningly at Tuppence. ""Is he one of them, do you think?"" she breathed. Tuppence shook her head. ""No, no. It's all right."" She took Jane's hand in hers. ""Tommy wouldn't have told us to do this unless he was sure we'd be all right."" ""But he doesn't know them as I do!"" The girl shivered. ""You can't understand.

""Well,"" she added, ""I told Allen he was sure to be the first."" Agatha looked at her in evident bewilderment, but she nodded. ""Yes,"" she said, ""of course, I knew it would come. Everybody knows by now that you have fallen out with Gregory."" ""But, as I told you, I haven\'t fallen out with him."" ""Then you certainly haven\'t married him, and if you have said \'No\' to Harry Wyllard because you would sooner take Gregory after all, you\'re a singularly unwise young woman. Anyway, you\'ll have to meet him when he comes to supper. Allen\'s fond of a talk with Harry; I can\'t have him kept away."" ""I was a little afraid of that,"" said Agatha quietly. ""What makes the situation more difficult is that he told me he would ask me again."" Mrs. Hastings appeared thoughtful.

""Why did you do it?"" ""I thought you might save Gregory, if I told you."" ""That was all?"" Sally looked at her with incredulous eyes. ""No,"" answered Agatha simply, ""that was only part. It did not seem right that Gregory should go against Wyllard\'s wishes, and gamble the Range away on the wheat market."" She admitted it without hesitation, for she realized now exactly what had animated her to seek this painful interview. She was fighting Wyllard\'s battle, and that fact sustained her. Sally winced. ""Yes"" she agreed, ""I guess you had to tell me. He was fond of you. One could be proud of that. Harry Wyllard never did anything low down and mean."" Agatha did not resent her candor. Although this was a thing she would scarcely have credited a little while ago, she saw that the girl felt the contrast between Gregory\'s character and that of the man whose place he had taken, and regretted it. Agatha\'s eyes became dim with unshed tears. ""Wyllard, they think, is dead,"" she said, in a low voice. ""You have Gregory still.""

Sally looked at her with unveiled compassion, and Agatha did not shrink from it. ""Yes,"" she said, with a simplicity that became her, ""and Gregory must have someone to--take care of him. I must do it if I can."" There was no doubt that Agatha was stirred. This half-taught girl\'s quiet acceptance of the burden that many women must carry once more made her almost ashamed. ""We will leave it to you,"" she said. Then it became evident that there was another side to Sally\'s character, for her manner changed, and the suggestive hardness crept back into her eyes. ""Well,"" she said, ""I\'d most been expecting something of this kind when I heard that man Edmonds was going to the Range. He has got a pull on Gregory, but he\'s surely not going to feel quite happy when I get hold of him.""

At first I'd been only grateful to her for being so kind to me; but all the time I felt there was something about her I didn't like, and on the Irish boat I saw her talking to some queer-looking men, and from the way they looked I saw that they were talking about me. I remembered that she'd been quite near me on the Lusitania when Mr. Danvers gave me the packet, and before that she'd tried to talk to him once or twice. I began to get scared, but I didn't quite see what to do. ""I had a wild idea of stopping at Holyhead, and not going on to London that day, but I soon saw that that would be plumb foolishness.

She must say it--she could contrive no other sentence-- ""Mr. Deronda is in the next room."" ""Yes,"" said Mirah, in her former tone. ""He is reading Hebrew with my brother.""

""Yes, a dear brother who is ill-consumptive, and Mr. Deronda is the best of friends to him, as he has been to me,"" said Mirah, with the impulse that will not let us pass the mention of a precious person indifferently.

""Did she tell you that I went to her?"" said Gwendolen, abruptly, looking up at him. ""No,"" said Deronda. ""I don\'t understand you."" She turned away her eyes again, and sat thinking. Slowly the color dried out of face and neck, and she was as pale as before--with that almost withered paleness which is seen after a painful flush. At last she said--without turning toward him--in a low, measured voice, as if she were only thinking aloud in preparation for future speech-- ""But _can_ you marry?"" ""Yes,"" said Deronda, also in a low voice. ""I am going to marry.""

She called the man she had been talking to. He stood by the screen with his face in shadow. He spoke to me in French. His voice was very ordinary and quiet, but somehow, I don't know why, he scared me worse than the woman. I felt he'd seen right through me, but I went on playing my part. I asked again where I was, and then went on that there was something I MUST remember--MUST remember--only for the moment it was all gone. I worked myself up to be more and more distressed. He asked me my name. I said I didn't know--that I couldn't remember anything at all. ""Suddenly he caught my wrist, and began twisting it. The pain was awful.

""Mademoiselle,"" I answered, ""with the same inducement, yes!"" ""Monsieur has learned how to flatter,"" she remarked. ""It is an accomplishment which I never mastered,"" I declared. She sighed. All the time I knew quite well that she carried on this little war of words impatiently. There were other things of which she desired to speak. ""Tell me, monsieur,"" she said, ""what had he done to you, this man Tapilow?"" I shook my head. ""You must forgive me,"" I said. ""That is between him and me."" ""And Monsieur Louis,"" she murmured. ""Louis knew nothing about it,"" I declared. She seemed perplexed. She had evidently made up her mind that Louis had taken me there with the object of meeting Tapilow, and for some reason the truth was interesting to her. ""It was a quarrel about a woman, of course,"" she murmured,--""the friend of monsieur, or perhaps a relation. I am jealous! Tell me, then, that it was a relation.""

""Whither are you going?"" he asked. ""Away, Monsieur,"" she answered. ""I was realising that my journey had indeed been in vain."" He looked at her a second in silence. Then stepping forward: ""Mademoiselle,"" he said, very quietly, ""your arguments have prevailed, and it shall be as you desire. The ci-devant Vicomte d\'Ombreval shall go free."" Her face seemed to grow of a sudden paler, and for an instant she stood still as if robbed of understanding. Then she came forward with hands outheld. ""Said I not that you were good and generous? Said I not that you could be noble, Monsieur?"" she cried, as she caught his resisting hand and sought to carry it to her lips. ""God will bless you, Monsieur--"" He drew his hand away, but without roughness. ""Let us say no more, Mademoiselle,"" he begged. ""But I will,"" she answered him. ""I am not without heart, Monsieur, and now that you have given me this proof of the deep quality of your love, I--"" She paused, as', 'she shall run no further risks.

Having concluded, Monsieur de Garnache sat back in his chair, and threw one leg over the other, fixing his eyes upon the Seneschal\'s face and awaiting his reply. On that gross countenance before him he saw fall the shadow of perplexity. Tressan was monstrous ill-at-ease, and his face lost a good deal of its habitual plethora of colour. He sought to temporize.

The man from Paris looked at him a moment, then stood up suddenly, and shifted the carriages of his sword back to their normal position.

Mrs. Vandemeyer came down from London. She and the doctor asked me questions, experimented with various treatments. There was some talk of sending me to a specialist in Paris. In the end, they did not dare risk it. I overheard something that seemed to show that other people--friends--were looking for me. I learnt later that the nurse who had looked after me went to Paris, and consulted a specialist, representing herself to be me. He put her through some searching tests, and exposed her loss of memory to be fraudulent; but she had taken a note of his methods and reproduced them on me. I dare say I couldn't have deceived the specialist for a minute--a man who has made a lifelong study of a thing is unique--but I managed once again to hold my own with them. The fact that I'd not thought of myself as Jane Finn for so long made it easier. ""One night I was whisked off to London at a moment's notice. They took me back to the house in Soho.

He had, in fact, already seen one, and was in the act of returning with him when he met us. Of course I introduced myself to the French doctor as we came along together, for we fortunately got hold of a trap directly, so that no time was lost.

Doctor Thorne, like other guardians similarly circumstanced, began to explain that Sir Louis had already had a good deal of money, and had begun also to promise that more should be forthcoming in the event of good behaviour, when he was somewhat suddenly interrupted by Sir Louis.

Before a word more could be said between them they were silenced again by another interruption. The whist-party comprised Lady Lundie and the surgeon, playing as partners against Smith and Jones. Arnold sat behind the surgeon, taking a lesson in the game. One, Two, and Three, thus left to their own devices, naturally thought of the billiard-table; and, detecting Geoffrey asleep in his corner, advanced to disturb his slumbers, under the all-sufficing apology of ""Pool."" Geoffrey roused himself, and rubbed his eyes, and said, drowsily, ""All right."" As he rose, he looked at the opposite corner in which Sir Patrick and his niece were sitting. Blanche\'s self-possession, resolutely as she struggled to preserve it, was not strong enough to keep her eyes from turning toward Geoffrey with an expression which betrayed the reluctant interest that she now felt in him. He stopped, noticing something entirely new in the look with which the young lady was regarding him. ""Beg your pardon,"" said Geoffrey. ""Do you wish to speak to me?"" Blanche\'s face flushed all over. Her uncle came to the rescue. ""Miss Lundie and I hope you have slept well Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick, jocosely. ""That\'s all."" ""Oh? That\'s all?"" said Geoffrey still', 'looked like himself again. ""Why go indoors this lovely weather?"" he said. ""Suppose we take a turn in the garden?"" Blanche pressed Anne\'s hand significantly. The proposal was evidently made for a purpose. They turned the corner of the cottage and gained the large garden at the back--the two ladies walking together, arm in arm; Sir Patrick and Geoffrey following them. Little by little, Blanche quickened her pace. ""I have got my instructions,"" she whispered to Anne. ""Let\'s get out of his hearing."" It was more easily said than done. Geoffrey kept close behind them. ""Consider my lameness, Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick. ""Not quite so fast."" It was well intended. But Geoffrey\'s cunning had taken the alarm. Instead of dropping behind with Sir Patrick, he called to his wife. ""Consider Sir Patrick\'s lameness,"" he repeated. ""Not quite so fast."" Sir Patrick met that check with characteristic readiness. When Anne slackened her pace, he addressed himself to Geoffrey, stopping deliberately in the middle of the path. ""Let me give you my message from Holchester House,"" he said. The two ladies were still slowly walking on. Geoffrey was placed between the alternatives of staying with Sir Patrick and leaving them by themselves--or of following them and leaving Sir Patrick. Deliberately, on his side, he followed the ladies. Sir Patrick called him back. ""I told you I wished to speak to you,"" he said, sharply. Driven to bay, Geoffrey openly revealed his resolution to give Blanche no opportunity of speaking in private', 'look at Anne. The look was not returned--was not even seen. From the moment when she had taken her place by Sir Patrick, Anne\'s eyes had rested on Blanche. They never moved--they never for an instant lost their tender sadness--when the woman who hated her spoke. All that was beautiful and true in that noble nature seemed to find its one sufficient encouragement in Blanche. As she looked once more at the sister of the unforgotten days of old, its native beauty of expression shone out again in her worn and weary face. Every man in the room (but Geoffrey) looked at her; and every man (but Geoffrey) felt for her. Sir Patrick addressed a second question to his sister-in-law. ""Is there any one here to represent the interests of Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn?"" he asked. Lady Lundie referred Sir Patrick to Geoffrey himself. Without looking up, Geoffrey motioned with his big brown hand to Mr. Moy, sitting by his side. Mr. Moy (holding the legal rank in Scotland which corresponds to the rank held by solicitors in England) rose and bowed to Sir Patrick, with the courtesy due to a man eminent in his time at the Scottish Bar. ""I represent Mr. Delamayn,"" he said. ""I congratulate myself, Sir Patrick, on having your ability and experience to appeal to in the conduct of the pending inquiry.""

He was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at Donwell for two years. ""Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could go very well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls walked about the gardens. He did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of the day. He should like to see the old house again exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his, and Emma\'s, and Harriet\'s going there some very fine morning. He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--very kind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of dining out."" Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body\'s most ready concurrence. The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose', 'expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude. ""And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?"" said Mr. Weston. ""She will think Frank ought to ask her."" Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was almost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston might be his son\'s superior.--In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming, and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.--She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley\'s not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with', 'was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. It was through a series of strange blunders!"" ""And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the justice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which Mrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless girl--infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected."" Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again. ""Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all doing?--Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy! Every body is asleep!"" ""I am ready,"" said Emma, ""whenever I am wanted."" ""Whom are you going to dance with?"" asked Mr. Knightley. She hesitated a moment, and then replied, ""With you, if you will ask me."" ""Will you?"" said he, offering his hand. ""Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper."" ""Brother and sister! no, indeed."" CHAPTER III This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure.

It was alleged at one club that the present member for Tankerville had spent the greater part of the last two years at Dresden, and at another that he had called on Mr. Kennedy twice, once down in Scotland, and once at the hotel in Judd Street, with a view of inducing that gentleman to concede to a divorce. There was also a very romantic story afloat as to an engagement which had existed between Lady Laura and Phineas Finn before the lady had been induced by her father to marry the richer suitor. Various details were given in corroboration of these stories. Was it not known that the Earl had purchased the submission of Phineas Finn by a seat for his borough of Loughton? Was it not known that Lord Chiltern, the brother of Lady Laura, had fought a duel with Phineas Finn? Was it not known that Mr. Kennedy himself had been as it were coerced into quiescence by the singular fact that he had been saved from garotters in the street by the opportune interference of Phineas Finn?

""Why do you throw it in his teeth then that he does not give you more of his time?"" ""Why have you come to tell me to marry Mr. Phineas Finn? That is what I want to know. Mr. Phineas Finn, as far as I am aware, has not a shilling in the world,--except a month\'s salary now due to him from the Government. Mr. Phineas Finn I believe to be the son of a country doctor in Ireland,--with about seven sisters. Mr. Phineas Finn is a Roman Catholic. Mr. Phineas Finn is,--or was a short time ago,--in love with another lady; and Mr. Phineas Finn is not so much in love at this moment but what he is able to intrust his cause to an ambassador.

The information was given to him by Mr. Kennedy himself, who told him that he had been to Scotland to fetch her. In these days there was an acknowledged friendship between these two, but there was no intimacy. Indeed, Mr. Kennedy was a man who was hardly intimate with any other man. With Phineas he now and then exchanged a few words in the lobby of the House, and when they chanced to meet each other, they met as friends. Mr. Kennedy had no strong wish to see again in his house the man respecting whom he had ventured to caution his wife; but he was thoughtful; and thinking over it all, he found it better to ask him there. No one must know that there was any reason why Phineas should not come to his house; especially as all the world knew that Phineas had protected him from the garrotters.

One of the officers told me about him when he came in, and said that he was one of the best riders and swordsmen in the regiment. The adjutant told me that he has specially chosen him for you, because he had a particularly good mount, and that as your orderly it would be of great importance that he should be able to keep up with you. Of course, he got the horse when he was the colonel\'s orderly; and though he was sent back to the ranks six months ago, the colonel, who was really fond of the man, allowed him to keep it."" ""I thought it seemed an uncommonly good animal, when he led it into the stable,"" Fergus said. ""Plenty of bone, and splendid quarters. I hope he was not unwilling to come', 'though I cannot say whom; and yet, if he only joined a short time before we marched, it is not likely that I should have noticed him before."" ""It was the same thing with me, colonel,"" the major said. ""I have noticed him several times on the march and, while the rest of the regiment were plodding on in silence, he always seemed the centre of a merry group. I have often said, to myself, I wished we had a few more men in the regiment who could take the hardships they had to undergo as lightly and as merrily as he does. His face has also struck me as being somehow familiar. ""I was speaking to the sergeant about him, and he said that he was the most popular man in his company, and a general favourite. His temperament is altogether different from that of the majority of our soldiers, which is earnest and quiet."" Two or three of the other officers also spoke of noticing the cheerful influence he seemed to have on the men. ""I must have a talk with him,"" the colonel said, ""after the campaign is over, and find out something about it. It is quite evident that his pluck is as great as his cheerfulness, and it is certainly very extraordinary that a young and recently-joined soldier should have such an influence with men many years older than himself.

He looked longest at Tommy. ""You,"" he said beneath his breath. ""YOU! I might have known."" Seeing that he was disposed to offer no resistance, their grip slackened. Quick as a flash his left hand, the hand which bore the big signet ring, was raised to his lips.... ""'Ave, Caesar! te morituri salutant,'"" he said, still looking at Tommy. Then his face changed, and with a long convulsive shudder he fell forward in a crumpled heap, whilst an odour of bitter almonds filled the air. CHAPTER XXVII. A SUPPER PARTY AT THE SAVOY THE supper party given by Mr. Julius Hersheimmer to a few friends on the evening of the 30th will long be remembered in catering circles. It took place in a private room, and Mr. Hersheimmer's orders were brief and forcible. He gave carte blanche--and when a millionaire gives carte blanche he usually gets it! Every delicacy out of season was duly provided. Waiters carried bottles of ancient and royal vintage with loving care. The floral decorations defied the seasons, and fruits of the earth as far apart as May and November found themselves miraculously side by side. The list of guests was small and select. The American Ambassador, Mr. Carter, who had taken the liberty, he said, of bringing an old friend, Sir William Beresford, with him, Archdeacon Cowley, Dr. Hall,",3,French nobility and intrigue in the Napoleonic era,3_mademoiselle_monsieur_madame_marquise,"['mademoiselle', 'monsieur', 'madame', 'marquise', 'henri', 'french', 'marguerite', 'marquis', 'chevalier', 'napoleon']","['surely, well for monsieur to be seen too much in Paris to-day?

""Mademoiselle,"" I answered, ""with the same inducement, yes!"" ""Monsieur has learned how to flatter,"" she remarked. ""It is an accomplishment which I never mastered,"" I declared. She sighed. All the time I knew quite well that she carried on this little war of words impatiently. There were other things of which she desired to speak. ""Tell me, monsieur,"" she said, ""what had he done to you, this man Tapilow?"" I shook my head. ""You must forgive me,"" I said. ""That is between him and me."" ""And Monsieur Louis,"" she murmured. ""Louis knew nothing about it,"" I declared. She seemed perplexed. She had evidently made up her mind that Louis had taken me there with the object of meeting Tapilow, and for some reason the truth was interesting to her. ""It was a quarrel about a woman, of course,"" she murmured,--""the friend of monsieur, or perhaps a relation. I am jealous! Tell me, then, that it was a relation."" ""Mademoiselle,"" I answered gravely, ""I cannot discuss with you the cause of the quarrel between that man and myself. Forgive me if I remind you that it is a very painful subject.

She stopped, and as she turned, he observed that her lashes were wet. But in her heart there arose now a fresh hope, awakened by the name by which he had recalled her. ""Whither are you going?"" he asked. ""Away, Monsieur,"" she answered. ""I was realising that my journey had indeed been in vain."" He looked at her a second in silence. Then stepping forward: ""Mademoiselle,"" he said, very quietly, ""your arguments have prevailed, and it shall be as you desire. The ci-devant Vicomte d\'Ombreval shall go free."" Her face seemed to grow of a sudden paler, and for an instant she stood still as if robbed of understanding. Then she came forward with hands outheld. ""Said I not that you were good and generous? Said I not that you could be noble, Monsieur?"" she cried, as she caught his resisting hand and sought to carry it to her lips. ""God will bless you, Monsieur--"" He drew his hand away, but without roughness. ""Let us say no more, Mademoiselle,"" he begged. ""But I will,"" she answered him. ""I am not without heart, Monsieur, and now that you have given me this proof of the deep quality of your love, I--"" She paused, as', 'she shall run no further risks. ""My errand, monsieur, is to acquaint you with these facts, and to request you to proceed to Condillac and deliver thence Mademoiselle de La Vauvraye, whom I am subsequently to escort to Paris and place under Her Majesty\'s protection until such time as the new marquis shall return to claim her."" Having concluded, Monsieur de Garnache sat back in his chair, and threw one leg over the other, fixing his eyes upon the Seneschal\'s face and awaiting his reply. On that gross countenance before him he saw fall the shadow of perplexity. Tressan was monstrous ill-at-ease, and his face lost a good deal of its habitual plethora of colour. He sought to temporize.

The man from Paris looked at him a moment, then stood up suddenly, and shifted the carriages of his sword back to their normal position.

In his hand he held a cheque. ""Say, Tuppence,"" he began, ""will you do me a good turn? Take this, and get Jane regularly togged up for this evening. You're all coming to supper with me at the Savoy. See? Spare no expense. You get me?"" ""Sure thing,"" mimicked Tuppence. ""We shall enjoy ourselves. It will be a pleasure dressing Jane.

He did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of the day. He should like to see the old house again exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his, and Emma\'s, and Harriet\'s going there some very fine morning. He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--very kind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of dining out."" Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body\'s most ready concurrence. The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose', 'expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.

Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was almost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston might be his son\'s superior.--In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming, and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.--She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley\'s not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with', 'was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet.

Newspapers which had hinted at a general strike, and the inauguration of a reign of terror, were forced to hide their diminished heads. The bolder and more astute among them sought to prove that peace had been effected by following their counsels. In the Sunday papers a brief notice of the sudden death of Sir James Peel Edgerton, the famous K.C., had appeared. Monday's paper dealt appreciatively with the dead man's career.

Madame de Bellegarde opened her eyes; the scintillations had gone out of them; they were fixed and dead. But she smiled superbly with her narrow little lips, and repeated Newman\'s word. ""Amusing?

""Well, I hope so,"" said Newman. ""I rather suspect so. In that case, come again."" ""Ah, what an invitation!"" murmured Madame de Cintre, with something painful in her smile. ""Oh, I want Mr. Newman to come--particularly,"" said the young man. ""It will give me great pleasure. I shall be desolate if I miss one of his visits. But I maintain he must be brave.

When, a few moments later, he went to receive his visitor, he found him standing in the middle of his great gilded parlor and eying it from cornice to carpet.

""Do you hear that, Valentin?"" said Madame de Bellegarde. ""You amuse Mr. Newman."" ""Perhaps we shall all come to that!"" Valentin exclaimed.

""He is the old woman at second-hand,"" Newman said to himself, as he returned M. de Bellegarde\'s greeting. And this was the starting-point of a speculative theory, in his mind, that the late marquis had been a very amiable foreigner, with an inclination to take life easily and a sense that it was difficult for the husband of the stilted little lady by the fire to do so.

Kramenin had made a precipitate return to Russia, leaving England early on Sunday morning. The gang had fled from Astley Priors in a panic, leaving behind, in their haste, various damaging documents which compromised them hopelessly. With these proofs of conspiracy in their hands, aided further by a small brown diary taken from the pocket of the dead man which had contained a full and damning resume of the whole plot, the Government had called an eleventh-hour conference. The Labour leaders were forced to recognize that they had been used as a cat's paw. Certain concessions were made by the Government, and were eagerly accepted. It was to be Peace, not War! But the Cabinet knew by how narrow a margin they had escaped utter disaster. And burnt in on Mr. Carter's brain was the strange scene which had taken place in the house in Soho the night before. He had entered the squalid room to find that great man, the friend of a lifetime, dead--betrayed out of his own mouth. From the dead man's pocket-book he had retrieved the ill-omened draft treaty, and then and there, in the presence of the other three, it had been reduced to ashes.... England was saved!

The statement which they made began by acknowledging that they had not of themselves any original right to try such a question, the Czar himself, according to the ancient constitution of the empire, having sole and exclusive jurisdiction in all such affairs, without being beholden to his subjects in regard to them in any manner whatever; but, nevertheless, as the Czar had deemed it expedient to refer it to them, they accepted the responsibility, and, after having fully investigated the case, were now ready to pronounce judgment.

Julius flung her a grateful glance, and Jane came forward shyly to the allotted seat. Beautiful as she had seemed before, it was as nothing to the loveliness that now went fully adorned. Tuppence had performed her part faithfully. The model gown supplied by a famous dressmaker had been entitled ""A tiger lily."" It was all golds and reds and browns, and out of it rose the pure column of the girl's white throat, and the bronze masses of hair that crowned her lovely head. There was admiration in every eye, as she took her seat. Soon the supper party was in full swing, and with one accord Tommy was called upon for a full and complete explanation. ""You've been too darned close about the whole business,"" Julius accused him. ""You let on to me that you were off to the Argentine--though I guess you had your reasons for that.

He did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of the day. He should like to see the old house again exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his, and Emma\'s, and Harriet\'s going there some very fine morning. He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--very kind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of dining out."" Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body\'s most ready concurrence. The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose', 'expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude. ""And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?"" said Mr. Weston. ""She will think Frank ought to ask her."" Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was almost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston might be his son\'s superior.--In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming, and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.--She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley\'s not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with', 'was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet.

Then I remembered that it was Sir James who had discovered the false Jane Finn. In the end, I couldn't make up my mind--and just decided to take no chances either way.

Blanche\'s self-possession, resolutely as she struggled to preserve it, was not strong enough to keep her eyes from turning toward Geoffrey with an expression which betrayed the reluctant interest that she now felt in him. He stopped, noticing something entirely new in the look with which the young lady was regarding him. ""Beg your pardon,"" said Geoffrey. ""Do you wish to speak to me?""

Little by little, Blanche quickened her pace. ""I have got my instructions,"" she whispered to Anne. ""Let\'s get out of his hearing."" It was more easily said than done. Geoffrey kept close behind them. ""Consider my lameness, Mr. Delamayn,"" said Sir Patrick. ""Not quite so fast."" It was well intended. But Geoffrey\'s cunning had taken the alarm. Instead of dropping behind with Sir Patrick, he called to his wife. ""Consider Sir Patrick\'s lameness,"" he repeated. ""Not quite so fast."" Sir Patrick met that check with characteristic readiness. When Anne slackened her pace, he addressed himself to Geoffrey, stopping deliberately in the middle of the path. ""Let me give you my message from Holchester House,"" he said. The two ladies were still slowly walking on. Geoffrey was placed between the alternatives of staying with Sir Patrick and leaving them by themselves--or of following them and leaving Sir Patrick. Deliberately, on his side, he followed the ladies. Sir Patrick called him back. ""I told you I wished to speak to you,"" he said, sharply. Driven to bay, Geoffrey openly revealed his resolution to give Blanche no opportunity of speaking in private', 'look at Anne. The look was not returned--was not even seen.

If an officer meet with resistance in the execution of a process, he has an undoubted right to call any citizen to his assistance; and the acts of such assistant come within the protection of the law. I shall leave you to judge, gentlemen, from the testimony, how far the witness in this prosecution can be so considered, feeling less reluctance to submit the case thus informally to your decision, because there is yet another indictment to be tried, which involves heavier charges against the unfortunate prisoner.” The tone of Marmaduke was mild and insinuating, and, as his sentiments were given with such apparent impartiality, they did not fail of carrying due weight with the jury.

How, again, can government, or any joint concern, be carried on in a tolerable manner by people so envious that, if one among them seems likely to succeed in any thing, those who ought to cooperate with him form a tacit combination to make him fail? Whenever the general disposition of the people is such that each individual regards those only of his interests which are selfish, and does not dwell on, or concern himself for, his share of the general interest, in such a state of things good government is impossible. The influence of defects of intelligence in obstructing all the elements of good government requires no illustration. Government consists of acts done by human beings; and if the agents, or those who choose the agents, or those to whom the agents are responsible, or the lookers-on whose opinion ought to influence and check all these, are mere masses of ignorance, stupidity, and baleful prejudice, every operation of government will go wrong; while, in proportion as the men rise above this standard, so will the government improve in quality up to the point of excellence, attainable but nowhere attained, where the officers of government, themselves persons of superior virtue and intellect, are surrounded by the atmosphere of a virtuous and enlightened public opinion. The first element of good government, therefore, being the virtue and intelligence of the human beings composing the community, the most important point of excellence which any form of', 'amount power in the government adequate to preserve order and allow of progress in the people is incident rather to a wild and rude state of society generally than to any particular form of political union. When the people are too much attached to savage independence to be tolerant of the amount of power to which it is for their good that they should be subject, the state of society (as already observed) is not yet ripe for representative government. When the time for that government has arrived, sufficient power for all needful purposes is sure to reside in the sovereign assembly; and if enough of it is not intrusted to the executive, this can only arise from a jealous feeling on the part of the assembly toward the administration, never likely to exist but where the constitutional power of the assembly to turn them out of office has not yet sufficiently established itself. Wherever that constitutional right is admitted in principle and fully operative in practice, there is no fear that the assembly will not be willing to trust its own ministers with any amount of power really desirable; the danger is, on the contrary, lest they should grant it too ungrudgingly, and too indefinite in extent, since the power of the minister is the power of the body who make and who keep him so. It is, however, very likely, and is one of the dangers of a controlling assembly, that it may be lavish of powers, but', 'a great many people absolutely repudiate it; while, as yet, the attempt to give it the authority of a revelation has not been made. As Hume says with profound truth in the fourth essay, _On the First Principles of Government_:-- ""As force is always on the side of the governed, the governors have nothing to support them but opinion. It is, therefore, on opinion only that government is founded; and this maxim extends to the most despotic and most military governments, as well as to the most free and the most popular.""--(III. 31.) But if the whole fabric of social organisation rests on opinion, it may surely be fairly argued that, in the interests of self-preservation, if for no better reason, society has a right to see that the means of forming just opinions are placed within the reach of every one of its members; and, therefore, that due provision for education, at any rate, is a right and, indeed, a duty, of the state. The three opinions upon which all government, or the authority of the few over the many, is founded, says Hume, are public interest, right to power, and right to property. No government can permanently exist, unless the majority of the citizens, who are the ultimate depositary of Force, are convinced that it serves the general interest, that it has lawful authority, and that it respects individual rights:-- ""A government may endure for several ages, though the balance of power and the balance of property do']",governments - government - constitution - monarchy - authority - democracy - parliament - tyranny - institutions - legislative,0.0,False

""He doesn't want to marry me--he really only asked me out of kindness."" ""That's not very likely,"" scoffed Tommy. ""It's quite true. He's head over ears in love with Jane. I expect he's proposing to her now."" ""She'll do for him very nicely,"" said Tommy condescendingly. ""Don't you think she's the most lovely creature you've ever seen?"" ""Oh, I dare say."" ""But I suppose you prefer sterling worth,"" said Tuppence demurely. ""I--oh, dash it all, Tuppence, you know!"" ""I like your uncle, Tommy,"" said Tuppence, hastily creating a diversion. ""By the way, what are you going to do, accept Mr. Carter's offer of a Government job, or accept Julius's invitation and take a richly remunerated post in America on his ranch?"" ""I shall stick to the old ship, I think, though it's awfully good of Hersheimmer. But I feel you'd be more at home in London."" ""I don't see where I come in."" ""I do,"" said Tommy positively. Tuppence stole a glance at him sideways. ""There's the money, too,"" she observed thoughtfully. ""What money?"" ""We're going to get a cheque each.

I want to be first with some one; but I have never found the one yet that I cared for."" ""You had better wait till you find him,"" said he, raising himself up on his arm. ""Come, let us get up and go home. You have asked me for my advice, and I have given it you. Do not throw yourself away upon a man because other people ask you, and because you think you might as well oblige them and oblige him. If you do, you will soon live to repent it. What would you do, if after marrying this man you found there was some one you could love?"" ""I do not think it would come to that, Walter."" ""How can you tell? How can you prevent its coming to that, except by loving the man you do marry?

She turned away her head, but did not answer him at once. 'Do you understand how much I am in need of comfort?' 'You can do very well without comfort from me.' 'No, indeed. I shall live, no doubt; but I shall not do very well. As it is, I am not doing at all well. I am becoming sour and moody, and ill at ease with my friends. I would have you believe me, at any rate, when I say I love you.' 'I suppose you mean something.' 'I mean a great deal, dear. I mean all that a man can mean. That is it. You hardly understand that I am serious to the extent of ecstatic joy on the one side, and utter indifference to the world on the other. I shall never give it up till I learn that you are to be married to some one else.' 'What can I say, Mr Carbury?' 'That you will love me.' 'But if I don't?' 'Say that you will try.'

'You should try to forgive him, Marie.' 'Never. Do not tell him that I forgive him. I command you not to tell him that.

""Tuppence, you are the limit!"" ""It has been fun, hasn't it, Tommy? I do hope we shall have lots more adventures."" ""You're insatiable, Tuppence. I've had quite enough adventures for the present."" ""Well, shopping is almost as good,"" said Tuppence dreamily. ""Think of buying old furniture, and bright carpets, and futurist silk curtains, and a polished dining-table, and a divan with lots of cushions."" ""Hold hard,"" said Tommy. ""What's all this for?"" ""Possibly a house--but I think a flat."" ""Whose flat?"" ""You think I mind saying it, but I don't in the least! OURS, so there!"" ""You darling!"" cried Tommy, his arms tightly round her. ""I was determined to make you say it. I owe you something for the relentless way you've squashed me whenever I've tried to be sentimental."" Tuppence raised her face to his. The taxi proceeded on its course round the north side of Regent's Park. ""You haven't really proposed now,"" pointed out Tuppence. ""Not what our grandmothers would call a proposal. But after listening to a rotten one like Julius's, I'm inclined to let you off."" ""You won't be able to get out of marrying me, so don't you think it."" ""What fun it will be,"" responded Tuppence.

""Nothing will be spared on that account certainly,"" said the lawyer. ""But money will do a great many things. We would send all round the world if we could get evidence against that other man,--Lady Eustace\'s husband, you know."" ""Can any good be done by sending all round the world?"" ""He went back to his own home not long ago,--in Poland, I think,"" said Madame Goesler. ""Perhaps he got the instrument there, and brought it with him."" Mr. Low shook his head. ""Of course we are very ignorant;--but it would be a pity that everything should not be tried."" ""He might have got in and out of the window, you know,"" said the Duchess. Still Mr. Low shook his head. ""I believe things can always be found out, if only you take trouble enough. And trouble means money;--does it not? We wouldn\'t mind how many thousand pounds it cost; would we, Marie?"" ""I fear that the spending of thousands can do no good,"" said Mr. Low. ""But something must be done. You don\'t mean to say that Mr. Finn is to be hung because Lord Fawn says that he saw a man running along the street in a grey coat."" ""Certainly not."" ""There is nothing else against him;--nobody else saw him."" ""If there be nothing else against him he will be', 'all. Now, what is the interest of eight millions of dollars, say at three per cent.?"" Rollo began to calculate it in his mind; but before he had got through, Mr. George said that it was two hundred and forty thousand dollars a year. ""That,"" said Mr. George, ""is equal, with a proper allowance for repairs, to, say a thousand dollars per day. Now, do you think that the people who will come here to see it will get pleasure enough from it to amount in all to a thousand dollars a day?"" ""I don\'t know,"" said Rollo, doubtfully. ""I\'d give one dollar, I know, to see it."" ""Yes,"" said Mr. George, ""so would I; and I do not know but that there would be three hundred thousand to come in a year, including all the great occasions that would bring out immense assemblages from all the surrounding country."" ""At any rate, I hope they will finish it,"" said Rollo. ""So do I,"" said Mr. George. ""And I mean to put a little in the man\'s plate when I go down,"" said Rollo, ""and then I shall have a share in it."" ""I will too,"" said Mr. George. Accordingly, as they passed by the man when they were leaving the church, Mr. George put a franc into his plate, and Rollo half a franc. Just at the time that they put their money in, the party that Minnie belonged to came by, and the gentleman put in a silver coin', 'more prosperous one in the city."" At the close of the week came visitors--Frank, Doc Linyard, and a strange gentleman, who was introduced as Mr. Styles, the old sailor\'s lawyer friend. ""Mr. Styles says your claim is all right,"" said Doc Linyard, when introductions all round were over. ""He says as how you\'ll get twenty-five hundred dollars afore three months are up."" It was glorious news. ""Sure?"" asked Mrs. Dare, with tears in her eyes. ""Positive, madam,"" replied Mr. Styles. ""I will buy the claim for two thousand dollars if you need the money,"" he whispered. ""No, thank you; I can wait,"" she replied.

Ken over-ran it, and the hit gave Dale two bases. Ken realized that the varsity was now executing Worry Arthurs\' famous right-field hitting. The sudden knowledge seemed to give Ken the blind-staggers. The field was in a haze; the players blurred in his sight. He heard the crack of the ball and saw Raymond dash over and plunge down. Then the ball seemed to streak out of the grass toward him, and, as he bent over, it missed his hands and cracked on his shin. Again he fumbled wildly for it and made the throw in. The pain roused his rage. He bit his lips and called to himself: ""I\'ll stop them if it kills me!"" Dreer lined the ball over his head for a home-run. Hollis made a bid for a three-bagger, but Ken, by another hard sprint, knocked the ball down. Hickle then batted up a tremendously high fly. It went far beyond Ken and he ran and ran. It looked like a small pin-point of black up in the sky. Then he tried to judge it, to get under it. The white sky suddenly glazed over and the ball wavered this way and that. Ken lost it in the sun, found it again, and kept on running. Would it never come down? He had not reached it, he had run beyond it. In an agony he lunged out, and the ball fell into his hands and jumped out.', 'infield flies over the heads of their opponents. The merry audience cheered wildly. But Graves and Raymond ran back and caught three of these little pop flies, thus retiring the side. The old varsity had made six runs on nothing but deliberate bunts and daring dashes around the bases. Ken hurried in to the bench and heard some one call out, ""Ward up!"" He had forgotten he would have to bat. Stepping to the plate was like facing a cannon. One of the players yelled: ""Here he is, Dale! Here\'s the potato-pegger! Knock his block off!"" The cry was taken up by other players. ""Peg him, Dale! Peg him, Dale!"" And then the bleachers got it. Ken\'s dry tongue seemed pasted to the roof of his mouth. This Dale in baseball clothes with the lowering frown was not like the Dale Ken had known. Suddenly he swung his arm. Ken\'s quick eye caught the dark, shooting gleam of the ball. Involuntarily he ducked. ""Strike,"" called the umpire. Then Dale had not tried to hit him. Ken stepped up again. The pitcher whirled slowly this time, turning with long, easy motion, and threw underhand. The ball sailed, floated, soared. Long before it reached Ken it had fooled him completely. He chopped at it vainly. The next ball pitched came up swifter, but just before it crossed the plate it seemed to stop, as if pulled back by a string, and then dropped down. Ken fell to his knees trying to hit', 'He grasped it all as if baseball was all that made life worth living, and as if every moment was his last. He never thought of himself. He was only a part of the team, and that team, every moment, grew sharper, faster, fiercer. He revelled in the game. Schoonover was hit hard, but fast play by Raymond and Weir kept Herne\'s score down. The little second-baseman was here, there, everywhere, like a glint of light. Herne made runs, but Wayne also kept adding runs. Blake caught a foul fly off the bleachers; Trace made a beautiful catch; McCord was like a tower at first base, and little Dean went through the last stages of development that made him a star. Once in the eighth inning Ken became aware that Worry was punching him in the back and muttering: ""Look out, Peg! Listen! Murphy\'ll get one in Reddy\'s groove this time.... Oh-h!"" The crack of the ball, as well as Worry\'s yell, told Ken what had happened. Besides, he could see, and as the ball lined away for the fence, and the sprinter leaped into action, Ken jumped up and screamed: ""Oh, Reddy, it\'s over--over! No! Run! Run! Oh-h-h!"" In the shrill, piercing strife of sound Ken\'s scream seemed only a breath at his ears. He held to it, almost splitting his throat, while the sprinter twinkled round third base and came home like a thunderbolt.
