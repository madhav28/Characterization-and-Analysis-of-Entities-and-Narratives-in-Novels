0,"The Adventure of the Devil's Foot By Sir Arthur Conan Doyle In recording from time to time some of the curious experiences and interesting recollections which I associate with my long and intimate friendship with Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I have continually been faced by difficulties caused by his own aversion to publicity. To his sombre and cynical spirit all popular applause was always abhorrent, and nothing amused him more at the end of a successful case than to hand over the actual exposure to some orthodox official, and to listen with a mocking smile to the general chorus of misplaced congratulation. It was indeed this attitude upon the part of my friend and certainly not any lack of interesting material which has caused me of late years to lay very few of my records before the public. My participation in some of his adventures was always a privilege which entailed discretion and reticence upon me. It was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a telegram from Holmes last Tuesday--he has never been known to write where a telegram would serve--in the following terms: Why not tell them of the Cornish horror--strangest case I have handled. I have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter fresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should recount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may arrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the case and",Detective work and characters in Sherlock Holmes stories,Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,The Adventure of the Devil's Foot,Privacy vs. recognition (narrative) - Preference for anonymity over public acclaim (subnarrative),"The passage from ""The Adventure of the Devil's Foot"" highlights Sherlock Holmes' preference for privacy over public recognition, despite his successful career as a detective. Holmes' distaste for applause and his habit of letting orthodox officials take the credit for his work underline the narrative of favoring anonymity over acclaim. His actions and decisions, as narrated by his friend and chronicler, emphasize a unique characteristic of Holmes, setting a tone that aligns with the broader theme of privacy versus recognition. This narrative resonates with Holmes' mysterious personality and his unconventional approach to his profession, capturing the essence of a character who seeks satisfaction in intellectual challenge rather than public validation."," The passage from ""The Adventure of the Devil's Foot"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle presents the narrative <narrative>Privacy vs. recognition</narrative> with the subnarrative <subnarrative>Preference for anonymity over public acclaim</subnarrative>. This is evident through the description of Sherlock Holmes' aversion to publicity and his mocking smile when receiving undeserved congratulations. The narrator highlights Holmes' reluctance to be in the limelight, as well as his own discretion and reticence when participating in the detective's adventures. The passage suggests that the upcoming account of the ""Cornish horror"" is an exception to Holmes' general rule, implying that the case holds significant value or peculiarity. Overall, the narrative explores the tension between the desire for privacy and the recognition that often comes with success.",," Here's a possible reasoning for the passage ""The Adventure of the Devil's Foot"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle:

Narrative: Privacy vs. recognition
Subnarrative: Preference for anonymity over public acclaim

Explanation: The passage highlights Sherlock Holmes' aversion to publicity and his preference for anonymity over public recognition. The narrator notes that Holmes' ""sombre and cynical spirit"" is ""always abhorrent"" to popular applause, and that he takes pleasure in handing over the credit for his cases to ""some orthodox official"" rather than seeking to draw attention to himself. This attitude is a key aspect of Holmes' character and is reflected in his decision to request that the narrator recount a particularly notable case, the Cornish horror, despite his usual reluctance to seek publicity. The passage suggests that Holmes values discretion and reticence over public acclaim, and that this is a fundamental aspect of his personality.","The passage highlights a narrative of an elegant social gathering and communication, where characters engage in subtle dynamics of social hierarchy and influence. The description of Mrs. Cavendish's hosting of the gathering, along with the conversation about writing letters to various high-society individuals, suggests a nuanced social ladder and the influence wielded by individuals within it. The poised yet powerful persona of Mrs. Cavendish juxtaposed with the well-connected guests discussing social engagements vividly paints a narrative of navigating social hierarchies with finesse."

The most macabre and imaginative of plotters would hesitate before linking his morbid fancies with the unquestioned and tragic facts which reinforce the statement. Though the assertions contained in it are amazing and even monstrous, it is none the less forcing itself upon the general intelligence that they are true, and that we must readjust our ideas to the new situation. This world of ours appears to be separated by a slight and precarious margin of safety from a most singular and unexpected danger. I will endeavour in this narrative, which reproduces the original document in its necessarily somewhat fragmentary form, to lay before the reader the whole of the facts up to date, prefacing my statement by saying that, if there be any who doubt the narrative of Joyce-Armstrong, there can be no question at all as",Reading habits and preferences of a writer,Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,Tales of Terror and Mystery,Exploration of the unexplained and sinister (narrative) - Blurring the lines between reality and elaborate hoax (subnarrative),"The passage sets up a narrative that delves into unexplained and sinister themes as it discusses the so-called Joyce-Armstrong Fragment, now believed to be true despite its previously presumed nature as a practical joke. This narrative thrives on the ambiguity of the situation—how close reality might be to extraordinary danger, hence blurring the lines between real threats and what might initially appear as mere elaborate hoaxes. Such a premise challenges the reader's perception of reality within the narrative, effectively merging the sinister with the possibly fantastical, aligning well with the overarching themes of ""Tales of Terror and Mystery"" and thus exploring the unexplained in a tension-filled setting."," The narrative in the passage from ""Tales of Terror and Mystery"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle presents an exploration of the unexplained and sinister (narrative), as evidenced by the discussion of the Joyce-Armstrong Fragment, an extraordinary and monstrous narrative that was initially considered a hoax. However, the tragic and unquestioned facts surrounding the account have led readers to accept its truth, forcing them to reevaluate their understanding of the world and its potential dangers. This subnarrative of blurring the lines between reality and elaborate hoax is emphasized by the assertion that, despite initial skepticism, the events depicted in the Joyce-Armstrong Fragment are indeed true, and the world must now contend with a hitherto unknown and unexpected peril. This sets the stage for a tale of terror and mystery, where readers are invited to join in the exploration of the unexplained and sinister, questioning the boundaries between reality and imagination.",," Based on the passage from ""Tales of Terror and Mystery"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, I've identified the following narrative and subnarrative:

Narrative: Exploration of the unexplained and sinister

Subnarrative: Blurring the lines between reality and elaborate hoax

Explanation: The passage presents a mysterious and unsettling narrative that blurs the lines between reality and an elaborate hoax. The Joyce-Armstrong Fragment is initially considered a joke, but as the facts are presented, it becomes clear that the events described are true, forcing the reader to adjust their understanding of the world. The narrative raises questions about the nature of reality and the possibility of sinister forces lurking just beneath the surface, creating a sense of unease and uncertainty. The blurring of reality and hoax serves to heighten the sense of mystery and terror, drawing the reader into the narrative and challenging their perceptions of the world."," The passage discusses the narrative setting, characterized by the protagonist's return from the war and subsequent recuperation, leading to a chance encounter with an old acquaintance, John Cavendish. The rekindling of relationships and the backdrop of recovery from personal trauma contribute to the foundational elements of the narrative, emphasizing themes of reconnecting and uncovering truths from the past within a familiar yet changed environment. The passage also introduces a sense of distress brought about by Evelyn Howard's absence, who previously brought a sense of security. This shift, represented by Evelyn's departure and the emergence of Dr. Bauerstein as a suspicious figure, introduces a suspicious and unsettling atmosphere. The passage discusses the shift towards uncertainty and distrust, marked prominently by the altered dynamics in relationships and environment, once comforted by Evelyn's presence. This establishes a narrative of change and evolving uncertainties as the characters navigate their new dynamics and suspicions. The passage revolves around a conversation concerning the awareness and perception of crimes within a close-knit group, like a family. Miss Howard and the others debate the detectability of criminals and the nature of murder, wherein Miss Howard insists that family members or those intimately involved would inherently recognize the wrongdoer without formal proof. This belief in intuitive detection amid everyday familiarity feeds into the narrative of engaging with mystery and speculative deduction. The specific mention of poisoning and unrecognized crimes by Mrs. Cavendish points to the nuanced discussion on overlooked or subtle criminal acts, further enriching the subnarrative that focuses on crime detection and undiscovered offenses."
4,"BEYOND THE CITY By Arthur Conan Doyle CHAPTER I. THE NEW-COMERS. ""If you please, mum,"" said the voice of a domestic from somewhere round the angle of the door, ""number three is moving in."" Two little old ladies, who were sitting at either side of a table, sprang to their feet with ejaculations of interest, and rushed to the window of the sitting-room. ""Take care, Monica dear,"" said one, shrouding herself in the lace curtain; ""don't let them see us. ""No, no, Bertha. We must not give them reason to say that their neighbors are inquisitive. But I think that we are safe if we stand like this."" The open window looked out upon a sloping lawn, well trimmed and pleasant, with fuzzy rosebushes and a star-shaped bed of sweet-william. It was bounded by a low wooden fence, which screened it off from a broad, modern, new metaled road. At the other side of this road were three large detached deep-bodied villas with peaky eaves and small wooden balconies, each standing in its own little square of grass and of flowers. All three were equally new, but numbers one and two were curtained and sedate, with a human, sociable look to them; while number three, with yawning door and unkempt garden, had apparently only just received its furniture and made itself ready for its occupants.

As the two elder ladies react to the movement at number three, their discreet observations and careful avoidance of appearing too inquisitive align with the notion of acquainting themselves with neighborhood dynamics, suggesting an adaptation to changes within their community's composition, capturing a microcosm of social interaction and adaptation to new elements in their environment."," The narrative of the passage from ""Beyond the City"" by Arthur Conan Doyle can be described as 'Introduction to the neighborhood and observation' (narrative). This is because the text introduces the setting of a new neighborhood and focuses on the two little old ladies observing their new neighbors moving in.

This is demonstrated through the old ladies' interest in their new neighbors, their concern about not appearing too inquisitive, and their detailed examination of the newcomers' house and garden. The old ladies' behavior suggests that they are trying to adjust to the new neighbors and understand the dynamics of their new neighborhood.",," The passage ""BEYOND THE CITY"" by Arthur Conan Doyle has the narrative of ""Introduction to the neighborhood and observation"" and the subnarrative of ""Adjusting to new neighbors and neighborhood dynamics."" This is evident because the passage begins with the introduction of two little old ladies who are interested in observing their new neighbors moving into the house next door, number three. They carefully position themselves to watch the scene without being seen, indicating their curiosity and desire to learn more about their new neighbors. The passage highlights the old ladies' interest in the new neighbors and their desire to observe their behavior, which suggests that they are adjusting to the new dynamics of the neighborhood and are interested in getting to know their new neighbors.", The given passage falls under the narrative category as it describes the introduction to the neighborhood and observation (narrative) - Adjusting to new neighbors and neighborhood dynamics (subnarrative).

Bell & Sons, London and Bombay 1902 [All rights reserved] PREFACE For some reason, which may be either arrogance or apathy, the British are very slow to state their case to the world. At present the reasons for our actions and the methods which we have used are set forth in many Blue-books, tracts, and leaflets, but have never, so far as I know, been collected into one small volume. In view of the persistent slanders to which our politicians and our soldiers have been equally exposed, it becomes a duty which we owe to our national honour to lay the facts before the world. I wish someone more competent, and with some official authority, had undertaken the task, which I have tried to do as best I might from an independent standpoint. There was never a war in history in which the right was absolutely on one side, or in which no incidents of the campaign were open to criticism. I do not pretend that it was so here.

Close the door of that room behind you, shut off with it all the cares of the outer world, plunge back into the soothing company of the great dead, and then you are through the magic portal into that fair land whither worry and vexation can follow you no more. You have left all that is vulgar and all that is sordid behind you. There stand your noble, silent comrades, waiting in their ranks. Pass your eye down their files. Choose your man.

Surely there would be something eerie about a line of books were it not that familiarity has deadened our sense of it.

This transformative power of literature to transcend daily trials and connect with a larger, timeless narrative is central to the passage, highlighting themes of escapism, intellectual communion, and the enduring impact of literature on the human spirit."," The passage from ""Through the Magic Door"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle presents the narrative of ""Entering a timeless realm through literature"" (subnarrative: Books as gateways to transcending the mundane). This is evident as the author discusses the transformative power of books, likening them to a magic door that leads to a land free from worldly troubles. The books are personified as ""noble, silent comrades"" containing the very spirits of their authors, waiting to transport the reader into ""dreamland."" This narrative highlights the transcendent quality of literature, suggesting that books can serve as an escape from the mundane aspects of life. The subnarrative further emphasizes the notion that books are gateways to a different realm, where one can momentarily forget their troubles and immerse themselves in the company of great minds.

The passage suggests that a bookshelf, despite its humble appearance, holds the power to transport readers into a realm beyond the worries and cares of the world. The author describes books as ""mummified souls"" that contain the concentrated essence of their authors, allowing readers to access the personalities and spirits of the writers. This notion is reinforced by the hypothetical scenario of Shakespeare's return to earth, where readers would be fortunate enough to spend an hour with him. The passage implies that literature has the ability to transport readers into a timeless realm, where they can escape the mundane and connect with the greatest minds of the past."," In the passage, the author describes the magic door as a portal to a realm where one can escape from the cares of the outer world and immerse themselves in the soothing company of the great dead. The author emphasizes the idea that books are not just inanimate objects but rather contain the concentrated essence of a man, with their personalities and spirits at one's command. The passage also suggests that familiarity has diminished our perception of the miraculous good fortune we enjoy through the written word. It envisions a scenario where Shakespeare returned to Earth and offered an hour of his time to anyone who desired it. The passage's narrative setting involves an old acquaintance and a convalescent soldier, with the protagonist returning from the war and visiting Styles, an estate familiar from childhood. The rekindling of relationships and the backdrop of recovery from personal trauma contribute to the foundational elements of the narrative, emphasizing themes of reconnecting and uncovering truths from the past within a familiar yet changed environment. The passage also mentions a social gathering planning, where Mrs. Inglethorp organizes a bazaar, indicating a social event being arranged. However, the narrator immediately dislikes Mr. Inglethorp, suggesting an underlying tension or mistrust towards his character from the onset. The passage describes an elegant social gathering where characters interact with grace and subtlety, hinting at deeper personal and social dynamics. The description of Mrs. Cavendish, the manner in which she hosts the gathering, and the conversation about writing letters to various high-society individuals all point to a nuanced social ladder and the influence wielded by individuals within it. The passage's overall tone is one of appreciation for the written word and its ability to transcend time and space, offering an escape from the mundane and a gateway to transcending the ordinary."

CONAN DOYLE"" can be analyzed to derive a narrative of ""Exploration of the mystical and unknown"" with a subnarrative of ""Unveiling supernatural or unseen elements through scientific or experimental methods"".

This narrative is supported by the following reasoning:

*   The title ""THE GREAT KEINPLATZ EXPERIMENT"" suggests a scientific or experimental approach to understanding the unknown, implying that the story will involve a systematic investigation of mysterious phenomena.
*   The subtitle ""And Other Tales of Twilight and the Unseen"" further reinforces the idea that the collection of stories will explore the unknown or supernatural.
*   The first sentence of the first story, ""I can assure them, however, that they are quite mistaken, and that, although I only knew Sir Dominick from his writings, I was aware that he was a man of scientific and philosophical turn of mind,"" suggests that the story will involve a rational and methodical approach to understanding the unknown.
*   The use of phrases such as ""the unseen"" and ""twilight"" creates a sense of mystery and otherworldliness, implying that the stories will involve supernatural or paranormal elements.
*   The fact that the stories are collected in a single volume, with a title that suggests a focus on the unknown, further supports the idea that the narrative will involve an exploration of the mystical and unknown.

Overall, the title, subtitle, and opening sentence of the first story, as well as the use of language and the collection of stories in a single volume, all contribute to the narrative of ""Exploration of the mystical and unknown"" with a subnarrative of ""Unveiling supernatural or unseen elements through scientific or experimental methods"".",The passage you provided does not contain any information about the Great Keinplatz Experiment or other tales of Twilight and the Unseen.

20,"THE VITAL MESSAGE BY ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE PREFACE In ""The New Revelation"" the first dawn of the coming change has been described. In ""The Vital Message"" the sun has risen higher, and one sees more clearly and broadly what our new relations with the Unseen may be. As I look into the future of the human race I am reminded of how once, from amid the bleak chaos of rock and snow at the head of an Alpine pass, I looked down upon the far stretching view of Lombardy, shimmering in the sunshine and extending in one splendid panorama of blue lakes and green rolling hills until it melted into the golden haze which draped the far horizon. Such a promised land is at our very feet which, when we attain it, will make our present civilisation seem barren and uncouth. Already our vanguard is well over the pass. Nothing can now prevent us from reaching that wonderful land which stretches so clearly before those eyes which are opened to see it. That stimulating writer, V. C. Desertis, has remarked that the Second Coming, which has always been timed to follow Armageddon, may be fulfilled not by a descent of the spiritual to us, but by the ascent of our material plane to the spiritual, and the blending of the two phases of existence. It is, at least, a fascinating speculation. But without so complete an overthrow of the partition walls as this would imply we know enough already to",Spirituality and Philosophy of Virtue,Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,The Vital Message,Exploration of new spiritual relations (narrative) - Expansion of human perception and conceptual growth (subnarrative),"The narrative ""Exploration of new spiritual relations"" along with the sub-narrative ""Expansion of human perception and conceptual growth"" from ""The Vital Message"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is drawn from the passage that describes a transformative view of humanity's future and its evolving relationship with the spiritual realm. Doyle's metaphorical comparison of the alpine pass to the new spiritual perception and his discussion of humanity reaching 'that wonderful land,' delineate a broadening of human understanding and insight into spiritual connections. This aligns with the main narrative of traversing into a new dimension of spiritual relations and captures the expansive growth in human conceptualization of the cosmos and our place within it."," The narrative of ""Exploration of new spiritual relations"" in the passage from ""The Vital Message"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is derived from the description of the ""sun has risen higher"" and the ""new relations with the Unseen"" that humanity may develop. This reflects the broader theme of human perception and conceptual growth, as the passage suggests that humanity's understanding of the spiritual realm will become clearer and more comprehensive.

The sub-narrative of ""Expansion of human perception and conceptual growth"" is demonstrated through the metaphor of looking down upon the ""far stretching view of Lombardy"" and seeing ""blue lakes and green rolling hills until it melted into the golden haze which draped the far horizon."" This metaphor suggests that humanity is on the cusp of a new era of understanding and enlightenment, where our current civilization will seem ""barren and uncouth"" in comparison. The passage also hints at the possibility of a ""blending of the two phases of existence,"" further emphasizing the theme of expanded perception and conceptual growth.",," The passage ""The Vital Message"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle presents a narrative of ""Exploration of new spiritual relations"" with a sub-narrative of ""Expansion of human perception and conceptual growth"". This is derived from the passage that describes a future where humanity has reached a new level of understanding and connection with the spiritual realm, symbolized by the comparison of a breathtaking view of Lombardy. The passage suggests that humanity is on the cusp of a profound transformation, where the material and spiritual planes will blend, and our current civilization will seem primitive in comparison. This narrative is supported by the author's vision of a future where humanity has transcended its current limitations and is poised to enter a new era of enlightenment."," The passage highlights the idea of a new revelation and the rising sun, symbolizing a transformative era. It draws a parallel to the panoramic view of Lombardy, emphasizing the potential for a magnificent future. Additionally, it mentions the possibility of the Second Coming, where the spiritual realm descends to meet humanity, rather than the other way around. This concept of a spiritual ascent and the blending of physical and spiritual existence is intriguing and thought-provoking."

26,"THE TRAGEDY OF THE KOROSKO SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. CHAPTER I. The public may possibly wonder why it is that they have never heard in the papers of the fate of the passengers of the _Korosko_. In these days of universal press agencies, responsive to the slightest stimulus, it may well seem incredible that an international incident of such importance should remain so long unchronicled. Suffice it that there were very valid reasons, both of a personal and of a political nature, for holding it back. The facts were well known to a good number of people at the time, and some version of them did actually appear in a provincial paper, but was generally discredited. They have now been thrown into narrative form, the incidents having been collated from the sworn statements of Colonel Cochrane Cochrane, of the Army and Navy Club, and from the letters of Miss Adams, of Boston, Mass. These have been supplemented by the evidence of Captain Archer, of the Egyptian Camel Corps, as given before the secret Government inquiry at Cairo. Mr. James Stephens has refused to put his version of the matter into writing, but as these proofs have been submitted to him, and no correction or deletion has been made in them, it may be supposed that he has not succeeded in detecting any grave misstatement of fact, and that any objection which he may have to their publication depends rather upon private and personal scruples.

This is evident in the description of the inclement weather, with the snow and wind creating a gloomy atmosphere that mirrors Laura's disconsolate mood. The weather serves as a metaphor for her emotional state, reflecting her anxiety about Raffles Haw's potential absence. The interplay of nature and emotions is further highlighted through Robert's actions, as he examines the stormy conditions outside while his sister observes his expression.

Not only was her first-floor flat invaded at all hours by throngs of singular and often undesirable characters but her remarkable lodger showed an eccentricity and irregularity in his life which must have sorely tried her patience. His incredible untidiness, his addiction to music at strange hours, his occasional revolver practice within doors, his weird and often malodorous scientific experiments, and the atmosphere of violence and danger which hung around him made him the very worst tenant in London. On the other hand, his payments were princely. I have no doubt that the house might have been purchased at the price which Holmes paid for his rooms during the years that I was with him. The landlady stood in the deepest awe of him and never dared to interfere with him, however outrageous his proceedings might seem. She was fond of him, too, for he had a remarkable gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with women. He disliked and distrusted the sex, but he was always a chivalrous opponent. Knowing how genuine was her regard for him, I listened earnestly to her story when she came to my rooms in the second year of my married life and told me of the sad condition to which my poor friend was reduced.

36,"DANGER! AND OTHER STORIES BY ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE AUTHOR OF ""THE WHITE COMPANY,"" ""SIR NIGEL"" ""RODNEY STONE,"" ETC. LONDON JOHN MURRAY, ALBEMARLE STREET, W. 1918 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED PREFACE The Title story of this volume was written about eighteen months before the outbreak of the war, and was intended to direct public attention to the great danger which threatened this country. It is a matter of history how fully this warning has been justified and how, even down to the smallest details, the prediction has been fulfilled. The writer must, however, most thankfully admit that what he did not foresee was the energy and ingenuity with which the navy has found means to meet the new conditions. The great silent battle which has been fought beneath the waves has ended in the repulse of an armada far more dangerous than that of Spain. It may be objected that the writer, feeling the danger so strongly, should have taken other means than fiction to put his views before the authorities. The answer to this criticism is that he did indeed adopt every possible method, that he personally approached leading naval men and powerful editors, that he sent three separate minutes upon the danger to various public bodies, notably to the Committee for National Defence, and that he touched upon the matter in an article in _The Fortnightly Review_. In some unfortunate way subjects of national welfare are in this country continually subordinated to party politics, so that a self- evident proposition,",Nautical Voyages and Ships,Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,Danger! and Other Stories,Anticipation and foresightedness in storytelling (narrative) - Utilizing fiction to communicate real-world concerns (subnarrative),"The narrative of ""Anticipation and foresightedness in storytelling"" is derived from Doyle's creation of a story that pre-empts world events, emphasizing his vision and foresight in using narrative to alert the public about potential future threats as highlighted by the story being written eighteen months before World War I.

Conan Doyle October 17, 1897 A DESERT DRAMA CHAPTER I The public may possibly wonder why it is that they have never heard in the papers of the fate of the passengers of the __Korosko__. In these days of universal press agencies, responsive to the slightest stimulus, it may well seem incredible that an international incident of such importance should remain so long unchronicled. Suffice it that there were very valid reasons, both of a personal and political nature, for holding it back. The facts were well known to a good number of people at the time, and some version of them did actually appear in a provincial paper, but was generally discredited They have now been thrown into narrative form, the incidents having been collated from the sworn statements of Colonel Cochrane Cochrane, of the Army and Navy Club, and from the letters of Miss Adams, of Boston, Mass.

50,"A STUDY IN SCARLET. PART I. (_Being a reprint from the reminiscences of_ JOHN H. WATSON, M.D., _late of the Army Medical Department._) [2] CHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES. IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties. The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in","Sieges and battles involving cavalry, artillery, and infantry",Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,A Study In Scarlet,Introduction and Military Background (narrative) - Personal journey/training and wartime experiences (subnarrative),"The narrative ""Introduction and Military Background"" resonates with Dr. John Watson's narration of his early medical career and subsequent military service, which shapes his character and expertise as reflected in him taking his medical degree, training at Netley, and serving in Afghanistan during a war.

62,"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box By Sir Arthur Conan Doyle In choosing a few typical cases which illustrate the remarkable mental qualities of my friend, Sherlock Holmes, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to select those which presented the minimum of sensationalism, while offering a fair field for his talents.

With this short preface I shall turn to my notes of what proved to be a strange, though a peculiarly terrible, chain of events. It was a blazing hot day in August. Baker Street was like an oven, and the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of the house across the road was painful to the eye. It was hard to believe that these were the same walls which loomed so gloomily through the fogs of winter. Our blinds were half-drawn, and Holmes lay curled upon the sofa, reading and re-reading a letter which he had received by the morning post.

Further, the unusual behavior at dinner, particularly with different characters showing signs of agitation and altered routines (like Inglethorp not attending to his wife as usual) supports the theme of underlying secrets affecting relationships, leading to a palpable tension.

Overall, the passage sets the stage for a narrative that explores family dynamics, social interactions, and hidden truths within a familiar yet transformed environment. The interplay between the narrative and subnarrative elements creates a compelling backdrop for the unfolding events and adds depth to the characters and their relationships."
64,"A VISIT TO THREE FRONTS June 1916 BY ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE AUTHOR OF 'THE GREAT BOER WAR' PREFACE In the course of May 1916, the Italian authorities expressed a desire that some independent observer from Great Britain should visit their lines and report his impressions. It was at the time when our brave and capable allies had sustained a set-back in the Trentino owing to a sudden concentration of the Austrians, supported by very heavy artillery. I was asked to undertake this mission. In order to carry it out properly, I stipulated that I should be allowed to visit the British lines first, so that I might have some standard of comparison. The War Office kindly assented to my request. Later I obtained permission to pay a visit to the French front as well. Thus it was my great good fortune, at the very crisis of the war, to visit the battle line of each of the three great Western allies. I only wish that it had been within my power to complete my experiences in this seat of war by seeing the gallant little Belgian army which has done so remarkably well upon the extreme left wing of the hosts of freedom. My experiences and impressions are here set down, and may have some small effect in counteracting those mischievous misunderstandings and mutual belittlements which are eagerly fomented by our cunning enemy.

68,"The Adventure of the Red Circle By Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ""Well, Mrs. Warren, I cannot see that you have any particular cause for uneasiness, nor do I understand why I, whose time is of some value, should interfere in the matter. I really have other things to engage me."" So spoke Sherlock Holmes and turned back to the great scrapbook in which he was arranging and indexing some of his recent material. But the landlady had the pertinacity and also the cunning of her sex. She held her ground firmly. ""You arranged an affair for a lodger of mine last year,"" she said--""Mr. Fairdale Hobbs."" ""Ah, yes--a simple matter."" ""But he would never cease talking of it--your kindness, sir, and the way in which you brought light into the darkness. I remembered his words when I was in doubt and darkness myself. I know you could if you only would."" Holmes was accessible upon the side of flattery, and also, to do him justice, upon the side of kindliness. The two forces made him lay down his gum-brush with a sigh of resignation and push back his chair. ""Well, well, Mrs. Warren, let us hear about it, then. You don't object to tobacco, I take it? Thank you, Watson--the matches! You are uneasy, as I understand, because your new lodger remains in his rooms and you cannot see him. Why, bless you, Mrs. Warren, if I were your lodger you often would not see me for weeks on end.""",Detective work and characters in Sherlock Holmes stories,Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,The Adventure of the Red Circle,Resistance to engagement and persuasion (narrative) - Flattery and emotional appeal effecting decision (subnarrative),"The narrative ""Resistance to engagement and persuasion"" is illustrated by Sherlock Holmes initially showing reluctance to engage in Mrs. Warren's problems, placing more value on his own time and tasks. When Mrs. Warren uses flattery and recalls Holmes' previous assistance which had left a significant positive impact on another lodger, it plays into his kindness and responsiveness to flattery, ultimately persuading him to listen to her issues. This sequence aptly demonstrates how flattery and emotional appeal can influence decisions, aligning with the given subnarrative of how these tactics affect Holmes' decision-making process, pushing him from disinterest to engagement."," The narrative of 'Resistance to engagement and persuasion' is evident in the interaction between Sherlock Holmes and Mrs. Warren. At the beginning, Holmes resists getting involved in Mrs. Warren's matter, citing his busy schedule and other commitments. This resistance highlights the narrative of avoiding engagement. However, the subnarrative of 'Flattery and emotional appeal effecting decision' comes into play when Mrs. Warren uses flattery and emotional appeals to persuade Holmes. She brings up a previous case where Holmes had helped one of her lodgers, Mr. Fairdale Hobbs, and mentions how Hobbs kept praising Holmes's kindness. This emotional appeal, combined with Holmes's accessibility to flattery and kindliness, eventually leads him to lay down his work and listen to Mrs. Warren's concerns. Thus, the passage illustrates how resistance to engagement can be overcome by effective persuasion tactics such as flattery and emotional appeals.",," The passage from ""The Adventure of the Red Circle"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has the narrative of ""Resistance to engagement and persuasion (narrative) - Flattery and emotional appeal effecting decision (subnarrative)"".

This narrative is supported by the following reasoning:

The passage begins with Sherlock Holmes initially showing resistance to engagement and persuasion when Mrs. Warren asks for his help. He is dismissive of her concerns and implies that his time is valuable. However, Mrs. Warren uses flattery and emotional appeal to persuade him to listen to her problem. She mentions his previous kindness and the positive impact he had on her lodger, Mr. Fairdale Hobbs, which touches on Holmes' kind and helpful nature. Holmes is accessible to flattery and kindliness, and the combination of these forces eventually leads him to lay down his work and agree to listen to Mrs. Warren's concerns.

This narrative is supported by the subnarrative of ""Flattery and emotional appeal effecting decision"". Mrs. Warren uses her words to appeal to Holmes' sense of kindness and his reputation for being helpful, which ultimately leads to him deciding to engage with her problem. This is a classic example of how flattery and emotional appeal can be used to persuade someone to take action or make a decision."," The passage presents a narrative of elegant social interaction and communication, where the characters engage in subtle dynamics of social hierarchy and influence. The description of Mrs. Cavendish's social gathering and the conversation about writing letters to various high-society individuals suggest a nuanced social ladder and the power wielded by individuals within it. The poised yet powerful persona of Mrs. Cavendish, juxtaposed with the well-connected guests discussing social engagements, paints a vivid picture of navigating social hierarchies with finesse. This narrative aligns with the ""Negotiation and subterfuge"" category, as Tuppence cleverly manipulates the conversation to gain an advantage. She proposes a payment arrangement that initially sounds like blackmail but softens it by framing it as a payment for services in advance. Whittington's response oscillates between suspicion and reluctant admiration, indicating that he's aware he's being maneuvered but can't pinpoint the deceit. Tuppence's admission of her love for money and her moralization about life's surprises further underscores the strategy of deception or persuasion used within their exchange.

Another narrative in the passage is ""Unexpected encounter and suspicious offer."" The sudden encounter between Tuppence and Mr. Whittington, whose appearance initially evokes distrust from Tuppence, sets the stage for a narrative of doubt and suspicion. Tuppence's hesitancy and scrutiny when reviewing Whittington's card indicate her suspicion and caution. Whittington's assertion that he might be of use to Tuppence, coupled with his admission of following her, intensifies the dubious circumstances, suggesting ulterior motives beyond the surface-level courtesy. His unexpected proposition and the context of following her to make this offer prompt concerns about his intentions, fitting the narrative of a suspicious offer."

As you walk down the lanes you are conscious of the rich, silent forces of nature working all around you. The wet earth smells fruitful and luscious. Green shoots are peeping out everywhere. The twigs are stiff with their sap; and the moist, heavy English air is laden with a faintly resinous perfume. Buds in the hedges, lambs beneath them--everywhere the work of reproduction going forward! I can see it without, and I can feel it within. We also have our spring when the little arterioles dilate, the lymph flows in a brisker stream, the glands work harder, winnowing and straining. Every year nature readjusts the whole machine.

Narrative: Seasonal awakening and personal renewal
Subnarrative: Nature's vigorous revival mirrors internal changes

The passage describes the arrival of spring, with the natural world coming alive as buds break into green shoots, and the air is filled with a rich, silent force. The author, Professor Gilroy, reflects on this renewal, noting that it mirrors the internal changes happening within him, such as the dilation of arterioles, increased lymph flow, and harder-working glands.

74,"The Sign of the Four By Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Contents Chapter I The Science of Deduction Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantel-piece and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long, white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled back his left shirt-cuff. For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp point home, pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined arm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction. Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, but custom had not reconciled my mind to it. On the contrary, from day to day I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled nightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to protest. Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject, but there was that in the cool, nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty.

The first half is made up of a series of pictures of the past which maybe regarded as trial flights towards a larger ideal which I have long had in my mind. It has seemed to me that there is a region between actual story and actual history which has never been adequately exploited.

It establishes the setting by introducing Holmes' return from the war and his subsequent encounter with an old acquaintance, John Cavendish. The passage also engages in a discussion on crime detection and undiscovered offenses, with Miss Howard expressing the belief that family members or those intimately involved would inherently recognize the wrongdoer without formal proof. This belief in intuitive detection amid everyday familiarity feeds into the narrative of engaging with mystery and speculative deduction. Additionally, the passage introduces a sense of distress due to Evelyn Howard's absence, who previously brought a sense of security. This shift, represented by Evelyn's departure and the emergence of Dr. Bauerstein as a suspicious figure, introduces a suspicious and unsettling atmosphere. The ""premonition of approaching evil"" encapsulates this shift towards uncertainty and distrust, marked prominently by the altered dynamics in relationships and environment, once comforted by Evelyn's presence. This establishes a narrative of change and evolving uncertainties as the characters navigate their new dynamics and suspicions. Overall, the passage sets the stage for the narrative's exploration of human emotion, logic, and the interplay between mystery and deduction within a close-knit group."

But his spirits were too low for work. He sat in silence, with his fine shoulders bowed and his head upon his hands. Outside, through the grimy surgery window over a foreground of blackened brick and slate, a line of enormous chimneys like Cyclopean pillars upheld the lowering, dun-coloured cloud-bank.

96,"ROUND THE RED LAMP BEING FACTS AND FANCIES OF MEDICAL LIFE By SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE THE PREFACE. [Being an extract from a long and animated correspondence with a friend in America.] I quite recognise the force of your objection that an invalid or a woman in weak health would get no good from stories which attempt to treat some features of medical life with a certain amount of realism. If you deal with this life at all, however, and if you are anxious to make your doctors something more than marionettes, it is quite essential that you should paint the darker side, since it is that which is principally presented to the surgeon or physician. He sees many beautiful things, it is true, fortitude and heroism, love and self-sacrifice; but they are all called forth (as our nobler qualities are always called forth) by bitter sorrow and trial. One cannot write of medical life and be merry over it. Then why write of it, you may ask? If a subject is painful why treat it at all? I answer that it is the province of fiction to treat painful things as well as cheerful ones. The story which wiles away a weary hour fulfils an obviously good purpose, but not more so, I hold, than that which helps to emphasise the graver side of life. A tale which may startle the reader out of his usual grooves of thought, and shocks him into seriousness, plays the part of the",Medical encounters and treatments,Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,Round the Red Lamp,Realism in medical narratives (narrative) - Challenges faced by medical professionals and the inherent gravity of their experiences (subnarrative),"The passage highlights the realistic portrayal of medical life as filled with challenges and the serious emotional gravity these professionals face, which Conan Doyle argues is vital for creating authentically developed characters in literature. By addressing the darker and more challenging aspects, he conveys the emotional and moral complexities medical professionals grapple with, essential for narratives aiming to provide a comprehensive view of medical life. This aligns with the narrative claim that realistic depictions are necessary to truthfully represent the challenges and inherent gravity in the experiences of medical professionals, emphasizing the importance of not sanitizing these stories for the sake of comfort."," The passage from ""Round the Red Lamp"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle presents an argument for the inclusion of realism in medical narratives, citing the necessity of portraying the challenging aspects of the profession as a means to accurately depict the experiences of medical professionals. The author's reasoning can be broken down into the following points:

1. **Medical realism as a reflection of professional experiences (narrative)**: Doyle asserts that medical life, when depicted realistically, showcases the trials and tribulations faced by doctors, which are essential components of their professional lives (subnarrative).

2. **Medical narratives as a medium for exploring human nature (narrative)**: The author highlights that medical narratives, when infused with realism, provide an opportunity to delve into the complexities of human nature, emphasizing the nobler qualities that emerge during times of hardship (subnarrative).

3. **The role of fiction in addressing grave subjects (narrative)**: Doyle argues that fiction has a responsibility to address serious and painful topics, implying that avoiding such subjects would not only be a disservice to the reader but also limit the potential impact of the narrative (subnarrative).

4. **The power of fiction in challenging perspectives (narrative)**: The passage concludes by acknowledging the potential of fiction to ""startle the reader out of his usual grooves of thought"" and ""shock him into seriousness,"" reinforcing the idea that narratives with a foundation in reality can serve as a catalyst for reflection and introspection (subnarrative).

In summary, the passage advocates for the importance of realism in medical narratives as a means to accurately portray the experiences of medical professionals, explore human nature, address grave subjects, and challenge readers' perspectives.",," The passage discusses the importance of realism in medical narratives. It argues that while medical life is not always cheerful, it is essential to portray the darker side of it in fiction to make doctors more than just marionettes and to help readers understand the gravity of their experiences. The author believes that fiction can serve a good purpose by helping to emphasize the graver side of life and shock readers into seriousness. Therefore, the passage uses the narrative device of realism to highlight the challenges faced by medical professionals and the inherent gravity of their experiences."," The passage discusses the challenges faced by medical professionals and the inherent gravity of their experiences, highlighting the need to portray the darker side of medical life. The author argues that fiction has a role in exploring both painful and joyful aspects of life and that narratives can serve a purpose in emphasizing the seriousness of life. The story is set in a familiar environment, Styles, where the protagonist encounters an old acquaintance and a convalescent soldier. This setting allows for the exploration of themes of reconnecting and uncovering truths from the past within a familiar yet changed environment. The shift in atmosphere and relationships introduces a suspicious and unsettling atmosphere, marked by the altered dynamics in relationships and environment.

98,"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans By Sir Arthur Conan Doyle In the third week of November, in the year 1895, a dense yellow fog settled down upon London. From the Monday to the Thursday I doubt whether it was ever possible from our windows in Baker Street to see the loom of the opposite houses. The first day Holmes had spent in cross-indexing his huge book of references. The second and third had been patiently occupied upon a subject which he had recently made his hobby--the music of the Middle Ages. But when, for the fourth time, after pushing back our chairs from breakfast we saw the greasy, heavy brown swirl still drifting past us and condensing in oily drops upon the window-panes, my comrade's impatient and active nature could endure this drab existence no longer. He paced restlessly about our sitting-room in a fever of suppressed energy, biting his nails, tapping the furniture, and chafing against inaction. ""Nothing of interest in the paper, Watson?"" he said. I was aware that by anything of interest, Holmes meant anything of criminal interest. There was the news of a revolution, of a possible war, and of an impending change of government; but these did not come within the horizon of my companion. I could see nothing recorded in the shape of crime which was not commonplace and futile. Holmes groaned and resumed his restless meanderings.

This environmental factor profoundly affects Sherlock Holmes' behavior, leading to visible restlessness, impatience, and dissatisfaction with his surroundings. Holmes' actions, such as pacing and groaning, directly reflect the psychological impact of being confined and inactive, showing how an external condition like prolonged bad weather can deeply influence a character's mental state and actions. This subnarrative detailing the influence of the environment on Holmes serves to emphasize the broader theme of how settings can shape character behavior and mood."," The narrative in the passage from ""The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is ""Overwhelming monotony and inaction"" (narrative). This is demonstrated through the description of the dense yellow fog that settles on London, making it impossible to see the opposite houses from Baker Street for several days. The fog's persistent presence creates a sense of monotony and inaction, which significantly impacts the behavior of the character, Sherlock Holmes.

The subnarrative, ""Environmental and psychological impact on character behavior"" (subnarrative), is derived from the passage as the environmental factor of the fog contributes to Holmes' restlessness and impatience. The fog's drab existence negatively affects Holmes' active nature, causing him to pace restlessly, bite his nails, and tap the furniture in his frustration. The passage highlights how the external environment can have a profound psychological impact on a character's behavior, further emphasizing the narrative of overwhelming monotony and inaction.",," Here is the reasoning for the given passage:

The narrative of ""Overwhelming monotony and inaction"" along with the sub-narrative ""Environmental and psychological impact on character behavior"" is derived from the passage that describes the dense yellow fog settling over London, causing Holmes to feel restless and impatient. The fog creates a sense of monotony and inaction, which affects Holmes' behavior, as he is unable to focus on his work and becomes agitated. This reflects the overarching theme of the impact of environmental conditions on human behavior and psychology, specifically how the monotony and inaction caused by the fog affects Holmes' mood and behavior.

This narrative and subnarrative capture the essence of the passage, which highlights the psychological and environmental factors that influence human behavior, in this case, the impact of the fog on Holmes' behavior and mood.","The narrative of ""Frugality and resourcefulness in wartime"" along with the sub-narrative ""Household commits to waste reduction and recycling"" is derived from the passage that emphasizes setting an example of economy by saving every scrap of waste, signifying a strict management of resources. This reflects the overarching theme of careful and mindful conservation during difficult times, specifically a war period, where the household ensures nothing is wasted, representing a broader message of prudence and adaptation."

The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles I find it recorded in my notebook that it was a bleak and windy day towards the end of March in the year 1892. Holmes had received a telegram while we sat at our lunch, and he had scribbled a reply. He made no remark, but the matter remained in his thoughts, for he stood in front of the fire afterwards with a thoughtful face, smoking his pipe, and casting an occasional glance at the message. Suddenly he turned upon me with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. ""I suppose, Watson, we must look upon you as a man of letters,"" said he. ""How do you define the word 'grotesque'?"" ""Strange--remarkable,"" I suggested. He shook his head at my definition. ""There is surely something more than that,"" said he; ""some underlying suggestion of the tragic and the terrible. If you cast your mind back to some of those narratives with which you have afflicted a long-suffering public, you will recognize how often the grotesque has deepened into the criminal.

Holmes associates the term with underlying themes of tragedy and criminality, referring to past cases to illustrate his point. This element highlights the narrative's focus on mystery and the role of introspection and inference, as Holmes deduces deeper truths about seemingly bizarre events. The overall narrative and subnarrative are enriched by Sherlock's analytical reflections that connect peculiar occurrences to larger, ominous realities, thereby leading to profound insights about the nature of the grotesque and its frequent association with criminal acts."," The passage from ""The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle showcases the narrative of mystery and introspection, with the subnarrative of inference and deduction leading to deeper truths. This is demonstrated by the interaction between Holmes and Watson, where Holmes poses a question about the definition of the word ""grotesque,"" implying that the upcoming case or the telegram he received contains some unusual and possibly tragic elements. As readers familiar with the Sherlock Holmes series know, such mysteries often lead to the revelation of darker truths through Holmes' keen observational skills and deductive reasoning. In this instance, the telegram heralds a case that starts off as strange and remarkable but eventually uncovers a criminal conspiracy, as seen in Doyle's previous works, such as the affair of the red-headed men and the case of the five orange pips. This narrative and subnarrative structure set the stage for the unfolding mystery and the deeper revelations that await the characters and readers alike.",," The passage ""The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has the narrative of ""Mystery and introspection"" with the subnarrative of ""Inference and deduction lead to deeper truths"". This is evident from the conversation between Holmes and Watson, where they discuss the concept of the ""grotesque"" and how it can deepen into the criminal. Holmes suggests that the grotesque often has an underlying suggestion of the tragic and the terrible, and that it can lead to desperate attempts at robbery or even murder. This conversation highlights the theme of mystery and introspection, as Holmes and Watson engage in a speculative discussion about the nature of crime and detection. The subnarrative of ""Inference and deduction lead to deeper truths"" is also present, as Holmes uses his powers of observation and deduction to make inferences about the case, which ultimately lead to a deeper understanding of the truth."," The passage revolves around a conversation concerning the awareness and perception of crimes within a close-knit group, like a family. Miss Howard and the others debate the detectability of criminals and the nature of murder, wherein Miss Howard insists that family members or those intimately involved would inherently recognize the wrongdoer without formal proof. This belief in intuitive detection amid everyday familiarity feeds into the narrative of engaging with mystery and speculative deduction. The specific mention of poisoning and unrecognized crimes by Mrs. Cavendish, points to the nuanced discussion on overlooked or subtle criminal acts, further enriching the subnarrative that focuses on crime detection and undiscovered offenses."

March, 1918 PREFACE Many more philosophic minds than mine have thought over the religious side of this subject and many more scientific brains have turned their attention to its phenomenal aspect. So far as I know, however, there has been no former attempt to show the exact relation of the one to the other. I feel that if I should succeed in making this a little more clear I shall have helped in what I regard as far the most important question with which the human race is concerned. A celebrated Psychic, Mrs. Piper, uttered, in the year 1899 words which were recorded by Dr. Hodgson at the time. She was speaking in trance upon the future of spiritual religion, and she said: ""In the next century this will be astonishingly perceptible to the minds of men. I will also make a statement which you will surely see verified. Before the clear revelation of spirit communication there will be a terrible war in different parts of the world. The entire world must be purified and cleansed before mortal can see, through his spiritual vision, his friends on this side and it will take just this line of action to bring about a state of perfection. Friend, kindly think of this.""",Spirituality and Philosophy of Virtue,Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,The New Revelation,Exploring the interconnection of science and spirituality (narrative) - Prediction and foresight through spiritual means (subnarrative),"The narrative of ""Exploring the interconnection of science and spirituality"" stems from Doyle's discussion on the relation between the religious and phenomenal aspects of spiritualism in the preface, indicating his quest to understand and articulate their interconnection.
